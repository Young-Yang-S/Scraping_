Wintrust Financial,WTFC, IL,Rosemont,"January 5, 2009",,(3),2.0,4.0,,,2.5,3.5,1.0,,,,,,Senior Vice President ,"Doesn't Recommend, Disapproves of CEO",,,,,,,,,Wintrust financial allows each bank president to tailor the loan and deposit products to meet the needs of the community it serves. Some of the banks have a strong following in the community and devoted employees to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction. The bank president has the authority to run the charter as his/her own business which allows for an entreprenureal spirt only found in a start up bank. The employee benefits package is very generous and competes strongly with employers of similar industries. The bank is large enough (when one considers all charters as one) to compete with the larger banks in the area; this eliminates many of the objections when working with customers who are concerned about moving to a community bank.,"The communication and sharing of information between the banks is extreamly limited. The leadership from the holding company does not trickle down to the bank level. Accountability for the banks performance is only judged on a profitability basis and does not incorporate employee turnover or customer satisfaction. It does not appear bank presidents of less profitable charters are held accountable for thier performance and poor performance is allowed to continue year over year. Senior management is a good old boys club made up from the original people who started the bank, no room for new ideas or opinions in this environment. The lack of diversity within the organization is concerning and does not promote opportunities for women or people of color.",Holding company officials need to be more involved at the bank level to ensure that the bank president is providing the leadership and communication to carry out the organizations goals and inititatives. Improvment in information sharing and communication between the banks would reduce lost productivity. Having an operations staff at each charter is a large duplication of job function with little financial return for the redundancy which is also complicated by the vast diferences in knowledge and expierience of similar positions at each bank charter. Leadership training for all senior managment and some type of oversight would better improve the level of bank presidents at each location.
