Easier than firing an employee they wanted gone, I suppose. Every year at Mobile Mini I made more money than the year before except when the economy crashed in 2008 and the last two years. The compensation package, contrary to what MMI will tell you, pays employees less now than this time last year. In theory you can put out more units per month and make 10% less than under the last package. Couple that with adding reps to your branch and gerrymandering the territories MMI can control what a rep makes. I went from almost 100k to 60 grand in two years. It is my belief that MMI values the ISR at about $55-60 grand. It seams that if reps consistently make more they will tweek the package to bring that payout down.",Value your ISR's more.

They have a minimum customer damage charge that they must charge no matter what or whom the customer you are trying to charge. Company charges clients $1000.00 if customer needs the building picked up within 30 days even tho our competitors don’t charge. This makes it very difficult to keep customers.  The company would rather lose a deal because customer doesn’t want to lease the furniture or “VAPS” for the building.  The company doesn’t pay vendors even tho it risk having a deal late and risk the relationship with the client BUT will go out and spend thousands of dollars traveling and paying for an open tab at the bar. Priorities are in the wrong direction.  We are now wanting charge the client a premium to make the building standard even tho we have charged the client before to make it custom and then charged them again to make the unit back to standard.

CONSTANT putting projects off until the last minute and then freaking out trying to get it done before the deadline and expecting good results with little time to deliver them. That left a LOT and I mean A LOT of cut corners. Some days I was embarrassed with what we were delivering to customers and it was all because of horrid time management and unwise job delegating within the branch management. Corporate would probably have been upset if they could have been there for a few weeks to observe. Then there are the safety ""blow ups"". This happens every 4 months or so, when management hears some corporate big wig is visiting and then decides ""STOP EVERYTHING! Get this place cleaned up to give the ILLUSION we actually take care of the place when they aren't around."" The next thing that happens is they get HUGE on random safety topics. That lasts for about a week. Then it gets chill again. This process repeats itself like clockwork 3-4 times a year. Rumors also spread like wildfire. ONE bad rap from ONE person makes it to management or a manager doesnt like you, its over. No getting out of that hole. Believe it or not, this is the short version of all the stupidity, hypocrisy and ignorance that seems to just ooze from certain people at this company. The last thing thats worth mentioning is this: some may say (as I was also told), that they promote from the inside and you can work your way up. This is 50% true. Some have worked up to management positions. However, I worked at this company for 2 1/2 years including temp time and I witnessed someone get hired, work about 1 month as a service tech, then ""randomly"" get promoted to a position that before he was promoted, we only needed ONE of. He kept that position, somehow gained enough notoriety with the big man in the branch and was eventually (within a few months) making demands to people who had way more experience than him. His inexperience showed EVERY day. He was also a liar. A bad one that somehow got away with it. I am speaking for all of my past fellow employees here because we all saw it. We all suspected a conflict of interest due to him being buds with the branch manager. Just too much stuff getting swept under the rug to believe otherwise. All in all, sketchy management and bad deadline handling hurt this company and make it a frustrating place to work.","I would advise corporate managers to keep a tight reign on quick, suspicious promotions in the individual branches and establish a standard when it comes to dishonesty and out of work buddies or second hand connections working together.

They then switched everything up and started stumbling around in the dark. Their answer to every problem is to hire a middle manager to try to fix it. So many managers in this company that I don't even know what their job descriptions are. Hard to make money here. The average income I was told I would make is about $20k higher than what most reps actually make because of all the changes and new positions they've implemented. Don't get me wrong, the people with Legacy accounts and great territories can easily make six figures here, but a lot of us actually make a lot less. I haven't even seen raises in our hourly rate to make up for inflation every year. And whether you've been working here for 2 months or 20 years, you make the same base pay. They say the commission plan is ""Uncapped,"" but it's actually very inhibited by inventory, market pricing, and trucking capacity. Don't even try to schedule something while they try to get their Platinum Account units sent out. Expect an uphill battle to even get any commission in those months. They do not give you autonomy to be a sales professional here. Focused way too much on the metrics, call volume, and having to worry about what QA thinks about your calls can make you seem like a call center employee rather than a sales professional trying to build a relationship with someone. Lots of managers; very few leaders that know how to lead. Lots of nice people here, but also lots of poorly trained people that are afraid to take ownership of problems, and there were plenty of problems when I worked here. Sales Reps have had enough. Lots of people were looking for new jobs when I left. Change needs to happen.","I could see that some of management was trying to improve things, but there was never really any action. The new incentive plan just made the usual top reps with great territories get a free trip, and the rest of us reps get $15 gift cards...Look into paying your reps more and having less hand holding, or more talent will leave you sooner rather than later.

I've even been told that my opinion doesn't matter and because if you don't have exact proof of something happening let's say for instance writing down everything somebody says to you or video taping everything that happens to you in a specific day then technically it didn't happen so they don't actually take you seriously when you have a complaint. The worst part is the people that are some of the best employees there don't get any recognition most of the dispatchers and people that actually work their butts off for this company that actually make it what it is don't get the correct recognition they should. The other huge issue is that the base salary is a joke and they just lowered the commission structure and they're actually hiring more people than what they need and they're doing that on purpose so that the employees that work there are hardly making any commission. It's extremely hard to get to the levels of commission you actually need to in order to make some decent money there. Lastly there is hardly any way to advance within the company a lot of people can become a branch manager but it is a huge jump from being an inside sales representative to being a branch manager and there is no in-between position. The huge negative is that there are so many branch managers that are hired that have no idea what their employees actually do for instance they don't know exactly what the dispatcher does and they don't know what they're inside sales representative does so how can you effectively run a branch when you have no idea what it is the people that work for you are really supposed to be doing? Don't get me wrong there are some really good branch managers that work for this company but they are definitely few and far between. And forget about upper management they are basically all catering to each other and that's all they care about they do not care about any of the employees that are underneath them it's all get your numbers and get your calls or your fired ....done!,"Management needs to open their eyes to exactly what is going on at every Branch at every level I feel like most of them are naive to how employees are actually being treated within the company and this is only going to be to your downfall. You should also invest in more upper management that consists of females because without this other opinion things can get lopsided with a constant dominant male personality running things. You should also definitely reconsider your commission structure and think about rewarding the employees that have been there for a longer period of time. Loyalty should mean something at a a job and people should definitely be rewarded for being loyal and working hard for the company that they have stayed with. One of the biggest things that keeps employees happy and at their current position is salary, recognition and advancement opportunities to which all three of these things the company is lacking at this point"

WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings,WSC, AZ,Phoenix,"April 27, 2011",,(2),2.0,5.0,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,,,,Sales ,"Doesn't Recommend, Disapproves of CEO",,,,,,,,,Mobile Mini was a growing company with the best sales people and product in the industry. They made it fun and made it easy to balance work and family. The employees on the local levels are awesome and make it easy to spend 40 hours a week with them. Mobile Mini is always looking to improve and with that they go through tribulations. We do have the best security to offer our customers and that has kept us on top.,Mobile Mini trying to adapt and grow has hit some hard times. Centralizing sales and all the phone calls have made it extremely difficult on our customers and long time employees. It seems like MMI is always adding high end positions in corporate and laying off at the branches. We are so slim at the branches that it is making it difficult to send out quality products and satisfy our customers. A lot of our long time employees and customers are leaving us for the competition. MMI makes it very hard for people to do business with us and I only wish that they would listen to their employees and customers who are on the front lines and know first hand what is happening. We have taken a very simple process and made it very difficult. Customers cannot even call directly to the local branch they want. Contractors hate it. That is our core business. They told us contractors will always stay with the local branches and that isn't the case anymore. Hopefully the necessary changes are made before it is too late. I love MMI and it breaks my heart to see what is happening to them.,"Listen to the people at the branches. We are the ones that see everything first hand. We hear the complaints from the customers. We hear compettion raving about our call center. I have heard from several competitiors that by us centralizing everything we have increase their business and they love it. Our core customers are leaving us, because we make it to difficult to do business. Please find away to get in touch with what is really happening at the branches. Start our own survey for customers to see how dissatisfied they are with our phone system and the quality of our units because we do not have enough man power at the branches. Our stocks may be up, but so is our number of dissatisfied customers and we are powerless at the branches to fix it. All we can do is give them alternate ways to reach theirs salespeople so they do not leave us.."

The new regime came in, cut bonuses and immediately raised prices across the board. Reps are no longer allowed to actually negotiate. This is the price, take it or leave it. Oh but we have a a fancy lock! Newsflash - so does the competition!!! The training was good and gave reps high hopes in Tempe. Beautiful facility at the HQ but then you come home. I worked in a dump of an office that was embarrassing to have customers see. Of course I had to rush the customers out when they stopped by because they were wasting my valuable ""talk time"". Even though they may have been a paying customer management deems that 50 meaningless phone calls to contractors I talked to last week is more beneficial. Oh and customer service is a joke. We rarely had the product so we were told to promise the world then we we can't deliver therefore ticking off the customer. Oh and before I forget, this would be the same customer I need to call in a week to ask if they need more containers. Why in God's name would they rent from me again??? It should also be noted that we didn't have any product because we were doing a fantastic job!! I may be naive but from my experience good sales numbers are what matter - with Mobile Mini it has no bearing. I don't care if you are renting 500 / day - if you aren't making phone calls you are the scourge of the Earth. I've never been happier with a career decision that I am now that I've left. I took a pretty impressive pay CUT and am still happy I left."

The product is no better than anything else out there, but the price was always higher.   They promised the moon but delivered on nothing. Inflated the wages and expected earnings during the interview process. Not very customer focused at all, it was all about the bottom line with little regard for maintaining good client relations.  Just overall poor management. There were mass lay-offs two months after I was hired. . . and that included my position. An absolute waste having turned down other high profile jobs based on the opportunity that I was led to believe existed here.","Get your act together.
