There is a career path in every department and they’re willing to work with you if you want to gain experience in a different department. Same goes for lab work if there’s equipment you want experience with or another group you’d like to work with. The culture is very inclusive from all levels.,"Some positions have ceilings, but that goes for any company. There isn’t a metrology team, which forces the analysts to spend time evaluating equipment that isn’t running properly. It’s my opinion that adding a metrology team would allow the analysts to complete more revenue generating work.",Continue to be inclusive and hold the “open door” policy. The culture here is very integrated and I have yet to run into anyone that makes me feel like I’m beneath them. I believe work environment is a large contributing factor to employee’s satisfaction & success; I believe West is doing their part at keeping the work environment positive.

As an employee, it's nice to be a part of a business that makes such a big impact on patient lives. As a growing business, with a long history, there's a mix of both established employees, who have been with the company for many years, and lots of brand new employees too. When you meet people who have been a part of the company for thirty-plus years, you know you've found a company that's worth being a part of. New employees are bringing fresh thinking and newer ways of working to the table, and the combination of these two factors is creating positive change within West. There's also a real spirit of community at West. The work the teams do to raise money for local charities is impressive, and you can tell it's an important part of the culture.

I could for over 2 minutes but not 5 and after I got the job offer and accepted he calls me to tell me because of that he was resending the job offer.

I Passed everything but your ridiculous squat 5 min. test. Then I tell him I just got off a 12 hour shift and he didn't care, he was rude to me and told me there's no retesting and we don't want u. Well that's fine your loss. I am a good worker, I wanna see him be on his feet for 24 hours in 2 days and tell me I should still be able to do that test. He cant tell me that because he sits behind a desk and pushes a pencil. you can call me to change your mind and the answer is a hell no. You don't realize that u embarrassed me. I already put my 2 weeks in to my current job and everyone was expecting me to start this one and now u made embaressed me to go to work and say oh nevermind I cant squat for 5 minutes so I'm not leaving. hope your happy you made me look like a fool at my job I am at now and all for nothing.

There seemed to be a number of employee activities; employee engagement opportunities and I was informed that contractors would be able to participate in them. GMP training was good.,"My supervisor and the training person with whom I had the most contact initially gave the impression of casual and flexible professionalism with a relaxed attitude. This changed quickly after I encountered multiple difficulties accessing necessary training materials and attempted to ask clarifying questions about requirements (while also requesting assistance). My line of work required very close attention to detail and my mindset and work ethic, including inquiries I raised, were congruent with that. I was surprised to find that my attempts to ensure integrity in my documentation were ultimately dismissed, particularly after having been told of the necessity of meeting specific requirements (this was alternately presented in a scolding manner and then walked back, depending on what was being discussed and by whom). At one point I was even told by someone, in all seriousness, that ""It doesn't matter what is on the page, it's what the computer says"" - which is frankly a big concern for anyone involved in supporting electronic documentation. Shortly after I started, my supervisor returned from a scheduled absence of several days and stood at my desk first thing in the morning giving me negative feedback in front of other employees rather than using one of several open conference rooms within steps of my desk. The feedback provided was a combination of exaggerated and completely false statements provided by another person. I was completely shocked. Days afterward, I was dismissed without notice and with no reasons provided to me or my agency other than additional false statements. The company refused to provide information to the agency even upon their request (they had received no feedback prior to my dismissal). I had been enthusiastically recruited and welcomed to the company and was then essentially kicked to the curb. It was absolutely appalling.","Negative feedback should always be given in private. Supervisors should provide new employees with backup contacts able to assist if they are going to be absent. Encourage IT responsiveness to tickets.

Excellent and extremely focused work environment with a great cross team collaborative and open culture. 2. Very few organizations give opportunity to everyone to have open discussion with top level management like the CTO and even the CEO. 3. Very niche, state of the art technologies and products to work for. 4. Growth mindset exhibited by all the members of the current org unit 5. Very few companies invest so much on global travels to meet and work with cross time zone counterparts and promote One West culture 6. Plenty of opportunities to learn and show-case the good work!","I won't exactly call it con, but some areas of improvement I can think of is: 1. I am sure the management knows about it, but since the DTC org unit expanded significantly in a very short time, the office facilities (although extremely modern and high-tech) should be expanded to accommodate more head counts coming in, and employee recreational facilities should be provided. 2. Since my previous organization spent heavily on employee readiness and upskilling. This is one area that can definitely be improved. So, events like Hackathons, cross geographical trainings, technology certifications and access to learning resources can definitely help in employee readiness",Thanks for the support and opportunities so far.
