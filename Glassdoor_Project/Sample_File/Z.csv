Ultimately there is a need for a real estate portal like Zillow, and the company had such a huge headstart due to wise early strategic decisions, that it's success is almost guaranteed until the next great technology shake up (i.e. whatever replaces websites).  - Zillow bills itself as a competitive employer to the big tech giants. It is not. The pay is atleast 20% less. I took a lesser role at one of the giants down the street and received a 55% compensation increase. - It is full of second rate talent (good but not great) or semi-retired folks. That is to say Zillow hires a lot of people that can't get through the more stringent interview process of better companies. Additionally, talented employees who have paid their dues at better, but more challenging, companies will look to join Zillow when they have decided to ease up on the professional challenges but aren't ready to retire.

You will meet some of the best individuals you have ever met when working at Zillow with diverse experience. There is a lot to learn from all of these individuals and I wish management would take that into consideration more. There are some good engaging activities that take place, some better than others. Zillow has handled COVID19 well for us all. The recent announcement about being able to work from home until the end of 2020 took a lot of stress off of a lot of employees.

You are given metrics for the work that you do which can be rewarding.","Be sure before taking the position as a Zillow Offers Advisor that you throughly understand the position. The position itself can feel entirely draining at times because it will never be explained to you that it’s essentially a call center. Day to day rules can change in an instant with your workflow. Things you were told the day before do not matter. That comes with working at a start up, but understand they will not honor their word and everything is changing at a constant. One day you will be told that something doesn’t matter and the next day it does. I sometimes think it depends on your mangers attitude towards you that day. There is a lot of playing “favorites” in the office. I also think great intentions have been set for culture, but everyone has to play along or it will never work well. It’s a very big tattletale culture. Growth is not encouraged in the advisor role. Your manager will stunt your growth if it means benefiting them with your numbers. I have heard from multiple advisors that they feel their concern for growth isn’t taken into consideration. It is very disheartening when you work incredibly hard day in and day out and you will never be considered for more than the advisor role. Promotions to management or lead positions are few and far between. I know they are working on this, but you will be told false info to try to keep you in the role. A lot of whispering amongst management in the office. . .WFH has alleviated that stress a lot. I also wish the compensation plan would be geared more towards the individual and pay them as such. Sometimes you will hear what management has said about you, but they will never address their concern with you.",Ask your team members more about growth. Worry about the individuals and not the numbers so much sometimes. Happy team members will work and they will work very well to get the results you want. Stressed team members who aren’t provided with much guidance will start distancing and eventually leave. Realize that you are working with some really great people who have left behind sales careers to be apart of something that will eventually be bigger. We all have the same idea that you have. Let us contribute too. Great things happen we open are minds.

Zillow Group is a company that heavily promotes its level of diversity and inclusion; however, it is also the first company where I witnessed racism firsthand that was ignored by upper management and also the first company I worked at where several racial incidences were known to have occurred amongst its employees. As a person of color, I was followed from inside of the company office to my friend’s car by a Caucasian employee. As I began to drive away, this employee physically stopped the car and began to question me about who I was and why I was in the office. They wouldn’t let me leave until I answered them claiming that they didn’t recognize me which is hardly surprising given that there are several hundred employees working in the office with tens of new employees starting each week due to turnover. I was extremely shaken by this event and informed HR of the incident. Having spoken to 2 people in HR, both said that they didn’t believe it was racially motivated but was likely triggered by previous security issues. Firstly, I had never heard of this happening to my white counterparts nor should a company allow for its employees to police others and follow them to their vehicles. I did not pursue the issue further as I felt that my concerns were being ignored and that , as a person of color, I was made to feel as though I had just “misinterpreted the events” or at least, that’s what I was told. This is exactly why people of color don’t report these incidences and feel like their concerns aren’t heard. Towards the end of my time there, I had heard numerous stories of racism being rampant among its staff in Denver. I do know specifics; however, these are not my experiences to tell. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with how these issues were addressed and hopefully the Denver Office will make changes to provide a safe environment for its employees where you are not accosted by coworkers, minority or not, and for it to be blamed on “prior security issues”. I mentioned this during my exit interview, but based on my experiences, I have no doubt it was never addressed.",None

This is a big one. Here is the typical approval process: A project will need to be approved by your manager (very typical and necessary), then in a separate meeting, pitched to your mgr's mgr (no problem), and in a separate meeting, pitched to your mgr's mgr's mgr (am I in the movie Office Space? Why can't this be in the same meeting?), then pitched to stakeholders all in the span of 2 days and incorporating all mgr feedback along the way. This happens about 3 rounds a project and never happens in the same meeting. After that, it's simple math. You must schedule 4 separate meetings for each of the 3 rounds of feedback, that's 12 meetings for a month long project. Let's say you are assigned to 6-10 projects. That's conservatively, 72 meetings for 6 projects a month divided by 20 working days which equals 3-4 mgr meetings a day plus all the normal manager 1 on 1s, team meetings and company meetings.

Zillow,Z, WA,Seattle,"May 3, 2020",,(22),1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,1.0,Former,,,,, Anonymous Employee,"Doesn't Recommend, Neutral Outlook, No opinion of CEO",full time,,,,More than 3 years,,,,"My decision to join Zillow was heavily influenced by ratings/reviews here, months after joining I realized its internal environment is not always same as the public image Zillow maintains on media or this platform, may of my colleagues expressed similar opinions. I gave it one star simply because I am a tech person disappointed by Zillow. But certainly there are people with other preferences enjoying Zillow. So my review is not to complain but trying to list some pros & cons from an internal view for job seeking candidates, so hopefully if you do decide to join Zillow, you have a realistic expectation about what you are getting into. It's just my two cents and I try to be objective here:   (1)for most org, work life balance is awesome, considering the salary. I have seen some few teams with high pressure/work loads, if there is politics or you need to deliver important projects, but for most teams work load is not heavy (2)the salary could be very competitive if you have previous big tech companies working experience or elite university degree on your resume.  (3)For most teams, the hiring standards it very high, I have observed a strong favor towards ivy-league & top universities  (4)Zillow is a MBA/sales& marketing/PM culture dominating company instead of technology & start-up spirit dominating company. If you are coming from banking/consulting/sales/finance background, but want enjoy the salary & work-life balance of tech company, Zillow could be the best choice for you in Seattle. Actually I also found people from above background tend to stay at Zillow longer than people in engineers/tech/science, probably because other big four consulting companies/banking/sales positions in Seattle couldn't offer a better package. This eventually could cause some disadvantage for people in engineers/tech/science, as I will mention in the Cons part. (5)Work life balance make it perfect to raise family if you have kids or are planning to have. Lots of ex-employees from other big tech companies choose Zillow due to this, at the same time they can get a better pay. I never seen so many pregnant people in other companies, the maternity leave is also very generous.  (6)Good for young people. If you are fresh graduate just starting your career, Zillow is a decent choice to put on your resume. Many social events, snacks, candy wall, game room, parties. It's like a fraternity with many elites from elite schools.  (7)Location in Seattle is perfect, the building has awesome view.   In summary these are following type of people I found successful & enjoy working at Zillow:  - elite schools - Project management/banking/consulting/sales/marketing - stay here for family, kids, work life balance - fresh graduate starting career","- Company's major revenue sources are driven by sales/platform traffic instead of technology innovation, mostly coming from agent advertisement and potentially instant offer. 10+ years after started, Zillow was still lacking of core innovations/engineering products that generate stable revenue. Google has PageRank, maps, chrome, Android and many others, Microsoft has windows/office/cloud/Bing, Amazon started with platform but later has AWS and Alexa. Zillow is still like Expedia mostly relies on sales & business strategies, and maybe acquiring more companies.    - Engineering spirit & tech innovations are below industry standard. There is not enough innovative/engineering/research products that supporting revenue generation. Mostly innovations are just auxiliary parts added to Zillow website/platform, make it more user friendly. This make the situation ridiculous sometimes, on one side this company claim it's tech company, many hack-week initiatives, but most projects/research/engineering product delivered are just adding icing on the cake. I have seen many projects not delivered on time, but there is no consequences simply because they don't matter that much. Politics of ownership happens all the time, simply because capable/talented people are not essential to keep the ball rolling. On the other side, sales & business strategy orgs could be stressed out to meet KPI. In reality when a start-up pass the organic grow period, it will get saturated after a while.    - Many leaders are not tech-driven or young, but they joined Zillow at a good time when it was small. Later on as Zillow expanded, they got promoted due to seniority, not because their ability/merits. For security purpose, to keep their positions, they also hire even younger managers or employees and adding layers and layers beneath them. Then soon you found for such a small/mid size start-up company, the number of leaders are overwhelmingly high. You are either in a meeting/social events or on the way to a meeting/social events.   - Not so diverse here. Zillow is dominated by elite and aristocracy. To make up for it, there are also lots of diversity hires or promotions due to diversity consideration.   - You have to know the right leaders, and fit in their styles to climb up. Again deliver results doesn't always get rewarded, it really depends on whether your leaders are confident and competent, or your leaders are insecure.   - Your credits of hard working could be easily taken by some slackers. If you are not happy with that,    - Turnover for tech talent is high. When I was at Zillow, there were a chart showing percentage of employees joined the company after you. I found many Zillow employees left the company in 1.5 - 2.5 years. In around 2 years or so, I was ahead of >50% of company employees(partially due to expanding), due to several reasons mentioned above.    - Zillow could FIRE PEOPLE WITHOUT WARNING, IMMEDIATELY. Under the shining surface of vivid, young, vibrant, caring, tech-start up image of this company, you will see a culture very different if you stay long enough. During my not so long tenure with Zillow, I saw 4 of my colleagues terminated all of a sudden, additional 2 terminated but they were not colleagues I had direct working relationship with. The politics here could be scary sometimes, leaders were in a hurry to mute the disagreements & conflicts. Please consider this carefully if you rely on the salary here for a stable income or for visa sponsorships. There is no PIP or similar plan which provides you several months of cushion time.",- the most essential is to develop some core innovation products that can generate steady revenue and keep tech talents occupied

The company claims to take security seriously, but doesn't anywhere anymore except on paper. The team has had massive turn over in the past six months. (Which isn't surprising if you consider the level of management turnover in the IT org as a whole.)   The annual review system is broken. You can get zero compensation raise and zero equity without an explanation as to why -even if you met ALL of your performance goals and have good manager and peer review. If you ask for some rationale as to how this happened with an entire year of good feedback from management the only response you'll get is, ""Let's just focus on the future."" The annual review system seems to be based on how well your manager is liked by their manager. None of it makes any sense. So good luck getting a raise. Ever.  Honestly, if you are considering work on the security team at Zillow, you shouldn't. You can easily get hired elsewhere in town where the leadership takes security seriously. You can find somewhere where you won't have multiple managers in one year because of turnover. (literally) You can find a place that takes your career seriously.   The security team has seen high management turnover, zero career development, can't get traction with other teams, budget gets approved (verbally) then slashed over and over. Then upper management says asks why security hasn't solved for X problem. It's because we have no budget or headcount!",No advice. We both know who the problem is. Don't @ me.

In making a drastic career move as all advisors did, most (including myself) were very specific, vocal and very concerned about certain questions regarding our licenses as real estate agents. The questions were asked and answered and put to ease so that we could move forward in accepting the positions as advisors. A few short months later after vesting our time and our knowledge into Zillow Offers, we found that the questions we had answered were flipped and contradicted to what we were told. As months went by, many of the important items that brought us into the role (such as pay, performance and movement in the company) were changed. As Zillow Offers grew, we were proud to tell customers that Zillow is not a “Bait and Switch” company- which amazingly, they uphold that high standard, but unfortunately, I feel it did not apply to the treatment of advisors themselves. The growing of the company with constant changes made me feel like we were being set up for failure. When going through your interview process for this position, be wary of the answers given. If there is something that is a deal breaker for you taking the position, know that there is a chance what was told will be changed under the question asked: “Are you able to work in a fast moving, ever changing company.”","Truthfulness goes a long way in hiring. Whether it be the possibility of taking a hit in your personal financing, movement within the company or the possibility of overbearing workloads, you have to be up front. If no movement should be expected, be upfront about it. It’s ok to say it’s a rarity or it is VERY hard to move within Zillow Offers or Zillow Group as a whole. If workloads become unbearable to maintain the same amount of scope per customer expected, Zillow needs to allow common sense changes to help the advisors succeed. The major changes in a company don’t happen over night but planned for months/years, especially the changes that specifically affect employees. It is important to be upfront and transparent.

Just in the past months 4 people have announced their departure just within the Assessment team of Data Services. And it is no secret that more will soon follow suit. If anyone in the C-Level reads this it is 100% a rejection of the teams senior management. Any other explanation is simply false. It began with these 4, and many more are now looking to get out.   The teams senior managers are nothing but a clique of old school business people who's values are opposite to those of Zillows. They work to protect themselves and not those under them. If you are not one of their chosen 'favorites' you will go nowhere. This was 100% apparent in the latest promotions on the team. Everyone saw through the process and everyone knew who was going to be promoted before the process even started. The hiring process was biased and unfair from the start. People do not want to work for shady, dishonest people and your continued toleration of this team's leadership is jeopardizing the whole project.  Survey after survey comes and nothing changes. Low scores across the board. The managers want to point fingers but cannot point it at themselves. They are the problem. They pretend that no other people can do this job or understand the data but them, but the reality is that assessment data is messy but ultimately uncomplicated. Any person versed in data could lead this team to be better both in terms of morale and the data itself. None of the managers are technical and only slow the process down and interject themselves in processes to seem like they are important.   Morale is at an all time low on the team and people are burned out. If you are thinking of applying to this team because of the prospect of working for Zillow you should think again and look elsewhere. The novelty of working here soon wears off as this team is not in line with Zillow. You will see and talk to other people who love Zillow, their teams, and their managers. But you will not find that on this team.","If you want this team to succeed you need to bring in managers who share Zillow's core values. The current management team is only destroying morale and driving people to leave. Four people leaving at once is not a little blip in the data. It is a flashing warning sign of what is to come if new management is not put in place. If those at the top don't act this entire project will be a failure. You have smart, dedicated employees with the skills and subject matter knowledge, now give them the leaders they deserve."

You will be surrounded by these people day and in and day out, challenging you, helping you grow and making you a better professional and person. I'm incredibly happy to have had the opportunity to work among such an exceptional group of people.   Due to the highly selective nature of who they hire, the culture is by far one of the best in the world. It's not because of all the ""fluff"" (free food, free travel, insane holiday parties, incredible events, and the unlimited supply of office supplies to ensure you have what you need). No, it's truly the feel when walking through the doors of a Zillow office, regardless of location. You feel the energy, the drive, the endless pursuit to accomplish the Zillow mission.   Due to the selective nature of those hired that creates a phenomenal culture, you are then surrounded by limitless opportunities. The best example is a colleague of mine being brought on as a ""trainer,"" so to speak. Though, she was a graphics designer, marketing guru with an untapped imagination full of ideas. Fast forward 2 years later and our mission that was in all of our minds, was graphically created and brought to life physically, by this person. She is now a leader within her department creating marketing ideas, material...etc. You will not find a lack of opportunities because of the limitless amount of ideas that create those opportunities for you to pursue.   Lastly, leadership. Everyone knows the saying: You leave because of your manager. Zillow isn't perfect, but in my 4 years of experience, every leader I had was exceptional. They were exceptional because their common trait was, ""Servant Leadership."" Zillow's cultural identity in leadership is defined by the thought and action that your leaders serve you. Not the typical environment you see with boss man yelling commands and you follow. Your manager will look to help lift you to the next level and get you to the place you desire in your career at Zillow.   My life has been forever changed by Zillow professionally and personally. If you desire to be part of a revolutionary company that manages to have a start up feel with a Google-like culture, do everything you can to join this phenomenal company.","The only con that I personally encountered was the difficulty to fall into a solidified team who is seeking a new leader. The opportunities were there, but the idea of bringing an outsider into a solidified team who needed new ideas and change, was scary. Past experience aside, It'd be great to constantly push to innovate, build and bring new blood in to an already established team. This will ensure innovation always occurs or difficult times may lie ahead.","Continue seeking out the best candidates for leadership positions that don't always have every box checked off. The best leaders may not always be the most qualified compared to their peers on paper. But, reviewing their history across their entire performance history at ZG, alongside numerous internal referrals should help in giving the thumbs up to shake things up."

I came in new to the sales industry and Zillow really puts you in a sink-or-swim environment.  This is what you're day will look like - Log into Salesforce - Use their dialing system - Call around 60-150 people a day and try to sell them lead generation  What I liked was that management will listen to calls and give you good feedback but they are pretty hands off. Most of the customers you'll be calling - have probably been called by Zillow an average of 20-50 times per year. It can suck but it forces you to be a good salesman. You'll learn how to overcome resistance, create time constraints, demo, build your own follow up processes. Zillow is so quota focused (you hit your quota or you get fired) and they are pretty attainable, so you can't just coast.  If you work your butt off and you have sales ability you should be able to make six figures.  A lot of the sales managers I had were really good people that would listen to you and want you to succeed.   You can really leave your work at work. The second you clock out you aren't even allowed to send an email.   Even though this review is mainly negative - I would still recommend Zillow if you are serious about sales and want to build good fundamentals.","I started in early 2018 and left in early 2019 and this company is going downhill fast. I don't even know where to start.  If you are sales/support (read: Denver hires) they don't give a crap about you as a person. It's the only job I've had in my professional career where they treat you like a kid. You are paid hourly and have to clock-in and out. You have to be there at 7:30 every morning even if you are calling a region that won't be up for another hour or two. Limited vacation and they are really weird about quota relief. They have a policy where if you miss quota a couple times in a six month period you will get put on a final notice and let go. You have to get approval on vacation in advance and submit quota relief but you'll be scared to do that because you might be struggling that month.  Want to take a vacation the last week of a month when you're at quota so you won't have stress? Tough luck.  One of their core messages is ""Zillow is a team sport"" and it's the exact opposite. You'll be part of a 20 person team that is all calling the same accounts over and over and over. The people who do the best either spam emails (and never get in trouble for it) or call accounts that slip out of other reps name. I never once felt like I was winning sales because of my ability - it felt like I either got good inbounds or the timing was right when I called someone that a different rep demo'd a couple months ago.  They have done a terrible job at setting up salesforce and their auto dialing system is terrible. They will raise quota yearly without giving you a raise. They hire like 4-5 new reps every month to a team because they know people will get burned out.  When they launched Zillow Offers they started removing MAJOR regions and making it so you couldn't sell their anymore. I had friends in the Southeast that said Atlanta was basically 30% of their closings and they removed the city over night. They kept quota the same and basically said start selling crappy zip codes that agents don't want.   You'll go into a company sales meeting and they will waste your time saying stuff like ""EVERYONE BE A LION. GO OUT AND HUNT"" instead of talking about the things that matter to sales people like inbound lead flow or getting better data in the CRM (hmm maybe put a field for zip codes they've bought in the past...) .  They don't really care about their customers. They know there are major zip codes that deliver crappy leads because they still put their contact form on underpriced/unsellable plots of lands and when the agents complain they tell them tough luck. Prices got so outrageous that I felt guilty going over ROI and showing they would be lucky to even get a 1.5x ROI in most regions.   I checked back in and probably 30%+ of the best sales reps (many who had been there since Trulia) finally decided to leave.   In the end it's all about the money. You can sell hot, treat customers like crap and email spam as long as you hit numbers.",The way you have your sales org is problematic. There aren't enough inbounds to go around and you treat revenue growth as a problem you can throw sales reps at.

Quota is $8,000 per month which is extremely difficult since majority of real estate agents have already been burned by the product you’re trying to sell. It’s an extremely difficult and expensive sale to make and very hard quota to hit. Managers play favorites and will give leads to sales executives they are close with. You are very replaceable.

The contract-to-hire process was the worst. Despite being identical in function to every other Zillow employee, I felt like I was treated as a 2nd class citizen while a contractor. Contractors get terrible benefits, are excluded from certain events/activities, and when you are finally converted you lose your hire date - so all the time you spent as a contractor doesn't count. One thing that really made me feel excluded as a contractor was the fact I didn't get a z-Pal, which is a program they have for new hires that pairs them with someone from outside their team to bond with and introduce them to the company in a more informal way. The only reason people have to go through this unfortunate process is because management wants to make easier to let employees go if they don't live up to their expectations (my manager admitted this), which is a pretty bleak way of looking at it.  Growing Pains - As things scale up, Zillow has experienced growing pains in a few areas. I feel like leadership really needs to step it up on transparency and communication. As an individual contributor I feel like I'm in the dark on what's going on. Sometimes changes happen and I find out weeks later that something had changed.

None of the managers came and said goodbye to me when I put in my two weeks (which, they tell you to wrap it up within 10-15 min of giving notice, but at least they pay you for the two weeks), which is whatever, but just contributes to the ""you are extremely replaceable and ultimately don't matter here"" sales culture.

Management will ensure that you know you are at the bottom, and will go out of their way to make you remember it every day. The will gossip, openly judge you about non-work related aspects, and prevent you from ever trying to progress professionally. Zillow likes to shout that they are a great place to work, but there have been multiple occurrences where employees have tried to speak up and the result was always the same: nothing. Then based off previous comments to reviews they will reply with ""we have not heard this level of feedback prior"". Unless someone along the chain is purposely preventing them from hearing this feedback, then this just goes to show how hard they work to keep up this facade of a great place to work.","Try getting someone outside the department to chat with the employees within DS.

Premier Agent Concierge was new and I thought it was innovative. I wasn't thrilled at working in a call center environment but the benefits, pay and people outweighed that. The biggest reason why I stayed at Zillow is because of the top notch benefits and the people. I would say about a third of the managers I had were excellent leaders. They kept me there. They didn't just say they valued my opinions-- their actions SHOWED me they did. Ultimately, Zillow gave me experience in a corporate environment and helped me develop skills that I now use in my dream job. For that, I am grateful!","The first year in PAC was great. People had their complaints but I realized that every company had their office politics. However, as the company grew FAST-- things changed. Management changed and department moral declined. I would go to all hands meetings and Spencer and Amy would deeply inspire me. Then I would go back to a department that felt so separate from the rest of the company. We weren't included in many functions that the rest of the company participated in. I realize that business needs dictate scheduling but there is always balance. Management spent so much time trying to convince us that we were no different than any other department when they could have exercised humility and OWNED IT. WE WERE DIFFERENT and you know what? That is okay. All I ever wanted was for management to admit that. Also, I understand that mistakes are made in corporate environments. That does not frustrate me. What frustrated me was that genuine apologies were never made, only excuses. I'm fairly confident I will receive a response to this assuring me that ""management did admit when they were wrong!"" An apology is not ""well, you know, possibly the messaging was not the most effective and we are looking into maybe changing this. However, the reason this happened is because we were in a time crunch and we were doing the best we could with the resources we had."" An apology does not include excuses. It is simply, ""We are sorry for our actions and we will strive to do better.""  Thankfully, for my last bit of time at ZG-- my team lead kept me engaged. They are the reason I stayed and I am so grateful for their encouragement and effective leadership skills.  Additionally, leadership was constantly asking for honesty and feedback. So, in skip levels, occasionally, I would speak up. I learned quickly that this was not effective. Generally, the response from management was: ""Thank you so much for sharing! However, do you realize how good you have it here? Most jobs didn't have free food and top notch benefits."" I must have heard 10 different versions of that answer. Again, I understand that you cannot just allow people to sit and complain without bringing up possible resolutions. I am not suggesting that managers should sit and allow people to vent without end. If your employees are venting in a kind and professional way, as a leader, you should listen and do your best to help them problem solve without making them feel like their thoughts and ideas are not valid. PAC had so much potential to be an amazing department (even with scheduling differences and limited access to functions and meetings). Unfortunately, during the time of my recent departure moral was continuing to decline. There are great people in PAC. People who care and who lead with kindness and humility. It is my hope that those people will take action and grab hold of the amazing idea that PAC stemmed from. I genuinely believe that the solution to many of the problems here is honesty and a willingness to be humble when you make a mistake.","Repeating myself a bit, simply be honest and transparent. During my years in PAC I cannot tell you how many times I heard the word ""transparency"" but it was almost never supported by actions. The times when I experienced transparency were (oddly enough) when that word was never mentioned. Here is the thing: I realize that there will always be issues to resolve within companies. My biggest ask is that when you have to tell PAC members that they cannot attend an event that the rest of the company will be at or that they can use their break time to quickly pop in-- OWN IT! Don't sugar coat it. It is what it is and I if you are simply open and real about the reality of the situation people will respond much better."

View from any floor is amazing.","It's really disappointing because i have a lot of friends that aren't in sales that work for Zillow and they can't stop talking about how much they love it. Zillows core values and direction and culture is absolutely amazing UNLESS you are on the sales floor. It is a shark eat shark environment where you can't trust anybody. Everyone is always trying to figure out ways to snake your deals, which results in a lot of bad blood and a pretty contentious relations with most of your coworkers. So if you like being a shady sales person in a turn-and-burn environment, this is a great job for you Training is the biggest joke imaginable and barely applies to what you are actually selling. All the managers focus on are daily activity metrics since they are under the impression the more dials you make the more business you will close, which isn't true. But if you don't hit your INSANE dial/activity metrics every day, then you will get a firm talking to. We are talking on average about 100 calls/day and another 150 talk minutes on top of it. You don't have time to strategically prospect and build relationships. I barely feel like i have time to take lunch. On top of that, it takes 70% of the team until the last day of the month to hit quota, so the stress literally never subsides. I stress like MAD when on vacation because you literally need every day possible to hit your goals. This is absolutely not how a job should be. I never felt able to breathe and cruise for just a day or two. The best part is that at any point in time you literally only have 3 month of job security. You are put on a PIP if you miss two month in a row (even by a minuscule amount) at that point you MUST hit 2 consecutive months to not get fired. I have seen so many talented people who just had a few bad months get let go. I have always wondered why Zillow Sales doesn't focus on developing existing talent. They much prefer to do hiring classes of 30 people every couple months and just see who can actually last. The turnover is absolutely mind blowing and i'd say the average tenure of an SE is 8-12 months. The product is hard to sell because so many agents have been burned by Zillow. What you do when you invest in Premier Agent is called GAMBLING. I didn't feel comfortable selling agents on a product that probably isn't going to make them money. It felt like i was stealing from good people.","Fix the issue of people snaking other people deals and make it a fair playing field. ""Salesforce Rules"" are INSANE. The fact that if you miss a follow up on someone you have been working with for months and if they accidentally falls out of your name that another SE who literally did nothing for the sale gets to close it and get 100% credit. Also, stop preaching about how ""transparent"" you are because it's very evident that you are not. Whether it be with how you send out inbounds, or how you feed deals to your favorites on the team, or lying about how much agents LOVE the new PA and they are lucky that we are calling them with the opportunity. Let's be real,, it's WAY overpriced, SE's just stress sell to get a credit card and will put agents in HORRIBLE positions. How is that fair to our clients?"

It is not easy work and we still have ways to go but I can confidently say we are authentic at Zillow about our commitment. For example, in the past few months, I have been able to communicate and get support around issues of bias that a few years ago I wouldn't have felt safe to address. I can't say enough how valuable this has been.  If we at Zillow keep going as passionately about this aspect of our culture as we have been the last two to three years we are going to be a model in the technology industry and beyond about the business and cultural value of making all employees feel welcomed and part of an organization. Because of the leadership buy-in, I believe we will continue on this path.   Also, you work with some of the smartest people in their given specialties.

The idea itself was grand ""creating the worlds largest and most vibrant home buying and selling platform"" but it takes the will to think big in order to make a company worth investing in, Zillow has done just that  Flexibility - When something isn't working Zillow's leadership team is not afraid to retool and rework it's original plan. This is an underrated trait of any company in my opinion because it means that you'll have to admit being wrong, which isn't as easy to do for some C level execs.   Leadership - speaking of the leadership team: Spencer Rascoff, Jeremy Wacksman, Stan Humphries, Rebekah Bastian, Lionel Lee, Jas Thind, Amy Bohutinsky and the numerous other fantastic, qualified names I've left out on this list are outstanding. They are the engine of this well oiled machine and the company's success is a function of their ability to simply do the right thing.   Autonomy - there a few sub points to this one for me including how I'm compensated (which is excellent) but I feel everyone should be trusted to do their job, that mean's not being micromanaged or harassed in any way. Zillow has a knack for putting its money where its collective mouth is and employing people who they know fit the culture and then trusting those people to do their job the right way by giving them all of the resources necessary. Excellent.   I could keep going but I'll cut it short","The Grind - I'll admit, when you're a company as large as ours it can be easy to lose sight of the purpose of your day to day at times. We have high expectations to deliver and at times that can mean doing a lot in a short amount of time with little understanding of who it benefits, it's a numbers game and at times that can make Wednesday afternoon at 3pm a drag.   Distractions - I used to work for a start up and even then it was hard to keep my email, Slack notifications, distracting open office chatter, and myriad of calendar invites to a minimum so that I could simply work and Zillow is no different. In fact, I would argue that the size of the company makes said distractions a bit of a headache, definitely something to consider if you, like me, struggle with simply staying focused on the task at hand.","Continue to build the Community and Culture team. This was an excellent idea and its still in its infancy as a department but as a member of an underrepresented group in tech I can honestly say that I'm planning to stick around for the next few years not because I just love my job so much (which I do) but because I don't feel alone for 9 hrs a day.

Collectively it’s a company that is consumer focused which also means it’s always focused on the long term. The CEO and the marketing people are probably some of the best in class. The company had a mission that I really believed in. I came to Zillow with an intense passion for what I do and despite the company’s shortcomings, for a long time, it was tolerable.","The biggest problems with Zillow Irvine is the abysmal compensation for all engineering and the interactions with HQ. Many Seattle engineers and managers will give you face but don’t really respect your opinions as engineers. The teams in our office were years ahead of Seattle on both software and operations technology yet we typically heard about how Seattle was the first to do X, 2 or 3 years after us. I consider myself and my colleagues quality engineers who deserved the same respect the two large offices receive. Zillow’s success largely depends on the important work we did.  The real root issue here is that Seattle treats the Irvine office, as well as others, as the “cheap labor” of the company. All levels of engineering here are paid shockingly below market for this area and even further below Seattle. Yet, The average home price in SoCal costs $300k more than Seattle (which Zillow, of course, is very aware of). There are lot of people living pay check to pay check who can barely afford their rent. People (especially those with families) come to work stressed on paying their bills on time. After many internal survey comments from many people, nothing’s really been done to address the massive pay gap even though equity is preached HEAVILY. Zillow uses stock to compensate employees but the issue there is that it’s basically worthless and it’s artificially kept low because Zillow reinvests or dilutes it’s own equity as soon as the price rises above most of our strike price. Zillow Irvine will lose a lot more talent if this trend continues once people realize they’re being grossly underpaid.  Also as the company has grown, a lot of the fun things about the culture have disappeared because they’re simply not allowed to have fun in a lot of ways. I’ve worked at larger companies that were still able to maintain a fun culture and somehow avoid a lot of trouble that Zillow finds itself in from time to time.","Pay all your employees what they’re worth and especially enough to make a living. When I left, neither was true. Don’t exploit your engineers. When your employees are brave enough to speak up about something, listen and most importantly DO something about it. Since it’s annual review season, do right by your employees and fix it."

Medical/dental/vision all offer great coverage, the well stocked kitchens are great, and the amount of PTO offered is generous.","Unfortunately, the cons of working in PAC seem to outweigh all the benefits the company has to offer. The company is headed in a great direction and does have a bright future, a lot of which depends on what the PAC department does, but they're not set up to fulfill this vision yet. The department is incredibly understaffed, particularly on weekends. This creates a negative environment because we are not living up to our promises and are setting ourselves up for failure. It's hard to remain motivated when you there are times that you simply cannot succeed, just because there are not enough people to do the job needed to be done. On days when the department is not running hours and hours behind schedule, there is still the problem of the job just being mundane and monotonous. For some, it may be an ideal position because it isn't the most mentally challenging job (though it is mentally draining), but for others with more ambition it can be a bit too simple. The Denver office, while growing, does not offer a lot of opportunities for growth in other departments, unless you're wanting to get into a sales role. Most of the job opportunities available will be at the headquarters in Seattle, which is unfortunate for those who do not wish to relocate. There are many other headaches that come with working as a Client Engagement Specialist, such as poor communication and lack of transparency at times, but right now the biggest issue is just the fact that the staffing levels are not set up in a way for us to do our jobs the way we should be doing them. They preach about a 6 Star experience for Beth, yet there are times that we're delivering a 1 star experience, if that. If the company has a specific vision, we should not begin executing it until we can do so in a way that provides our consumers with the service they deserve.","Re-evaluate staffing levels, especially on weekends, so that we are not providing a poor consumer experience. Communicate more effectively with all the teams and be more transparent with current issues."

They really stand behind their words with actual action. If people aren't satisfied with something, they listen, discuss, and take necessary action. They provide many avenues to voice your opinion, which empowers you as an employee and as a stakeholder in the company itself.  Culture isn't something they just talk about. They live it day in and day out by being active philanthropically, engendering a culture of respect, and providing avenues to unwind at work and outside of work.  Although Zillow is a large company, we still get plenty of opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology. There are hardly days where I feel like my team is stagnated or that I feel like technology is leaving us behind. The teams here aren't scared to work with bleeding-edge tech, and making mistakes or failing big is a part of the culture, not something frowned upon.  To summarize, if you're looking for a company that stands behind what they say and provides a challenging, yet fun place to work then Zillow is where you want to work.","I've been here for almost a year and so far I can't really pinpoint anything as a downside.

The workplace is transparent and the product teams are kept small so there can be autonomy to move fast and make an impact.   I'm generally skeptical of things like ""core values"", but Zillow has managed to roll out these big company concepts in a way that feels genuine. We're in a transition from a small company to a relatively big one (2k+) and the leadership team is taking deliberate steps to have the right amount of process to keep things running efficiently.  There's a strong emphasis on over all quality of life. Generous vacation, good parental leave (which everyone actually uses) and a culture that doesn't expect you to be connected all of the time.  Zillow has a dual-class stock structure that allows the Founders and CEO to have complete control over direction of the company, allowing for a long term vision. It exciting that Zillow is able to invest so much in the future, tear-down and rebuild business models and expand into adjacent markets even if it limits near term profits. No concern with activist investors here.

Over time, this transparency exposed me to every aspect of managing the business outside of my job description and expectations. This is something I would have never seen from the aforementioned large software company.","Restructuring the company to better handle a global slow down in advertisement markets, Zillow recently went through a reduction in force (RIF). This sudden and drastic change greatly affects the company makeup, it's culture, and it unavoidably drains the company of senior talent and ""tribal"" knowledge.  Rapid development and execution of ideas were largely a result of throwing lots of resources at a problem. Rather than rely on the product development team to quickly innovate and then refine an idea, execution of a plan was often bogged down quibling over minor details. Almost making the argument for the RIF, a smaller team with less oversight could deliver a similar, if not quite as polished product, in less time.","Some decisions are tough, but don't be afraid to openly share why certain decisions are made. By being selective about who Zillow hires, you can find employees who are passionate about working at Zillow; while those hard decisions will be met with disappointment, they will also be met with respect and understanding.

Yes, with any large company, it's impossible to make everyone happy, but overall theme is that employees love coming to work, love what they do and Zillow treats everyone very WELL. Anyone that says different is either not working here anymore or not old enough to have a professional, business attitude, which should be required for any job you can make over 6 figures in.  Here are a couple reasons why things are so great. First, compensation is world class. Given all the additional perks we receive here, subsidized medical premiums, free snacks and breakfast, GREAT PEOPLE, the best benefits ever offered and most of all, the best work hours you can ask for--those are what make Zillow so great.  It baffles me, the negative comments some people put on here about this company.

Therefore, the growth is really hard if you’re not willing to relocate. The entry position is a very easy CES position which is where most begin their Zillow career. However, there isn’t much of a system to monitor employees. You can be a top performer on your team and/or in the department, and the treatment is the same as the guy sitting next to you doing half the work but taking double the breaks. They claim this is monitored, but there doesn’t seem to be much managing of the “slackers”. Top performers are rarely recognized by upper management and receive zero incentive for their hard work and dedication to the company. It sucks. As managers are encouraged to help with career development, the room for growth is sparse and the demand is high. A survey is sent out to employees to provide feedback and every time I fill this out, I voice my opinion about compensating top performers and I never ever hear a word about it. They stress “power to the people” and that they hear us, but this topic continues to go unheard. It’s so un-motivating especially to the people who are actually dedicated. Employees are growing frustrated and morale is way down.","PAC managers should really listen to what their top performers are saying. You know who is dedicated and putting in the work vs. who is just getting by. Take your people more serious. I have been laughed at by a manager who forgot about a career development step that was discussed followed by a “my bad”. Not very professional and made me feel devalued. Every employee should be treated fairly and with respect, yes. But the person next me who is distracted all day doing minimal work as I make double the calls and stay focused on quantity yet we are viewed the same, no!

I have been that the company for three years and have seen significant growth in both my role and salary over that time. I started in Inside Sales with no prior sales experience and within a few months got the hang of it and was off and running. The first six months of any sales job is hard so I knew going in that it was going to be a grind until I could create a good book of business. After that six month mark my sales continued to grow and grow and the role became a lot more dynamic as I was getting new business and working with existing customers of mine.   During my time at Zillow, I have always been able to hit or exceed sales goals and the pay when doing so was at or above my expectations. Within the first two years I was promoted twice and am currently in a management role. I see lots of growth potential still and am excited for what is ahead for both the company and myself.   In addition, I have referred five different friends here and all of them are still here and enjoy Zillow as well.","The job is hard when you start, no way around that.

Im about to hit my two year mark as a sales consultant and I am very proud that I've been able to reach the stretch goals/quotas every month.

I've really enjoyed the challenge.","My biggest complaint would probably be regarding the expectation to bring 100% energy everyday or hit a certain number of phone calls or minutes everyday. Being on your ""A"" game everyday isn't really possible in my eyes. Some days I would prefer to work ""on"" my business rather than ""in"" it. With the daily eye on my activity I feel guilty taking breaks to recharge my batteries. Some days I may be really productive taking care of emails, finding new reports to be more effective and researching how to do my job better and those types of things aren't applauded because they aren't recorded in the sales dashboard.

That's actually the nicest and most professional way that I can say it. While I was there, and since I left, I have watched him destroy the careers of, push out, and ridicule some of the most talented salespeople and sales leaders that I've worked with. I had many 1 on 1 conversations with him over the years that left me feeling sick to my stomach. The way he views and treats the people whom are ""beneath him"" is not representative of how the CEO thinks or operates. So many talented people have left within the past couple of years, but not him. It begs the question; what does he have on them?

These are people who will be your lifelong friends and you will genuinely excited to see day in and day out.  Training is exceptional. If you want to learn how to sell, Zillow offers some of the best training top to bottom. From learning how prospect, qualify, and close, you will get a great crash course on how to truly sell.  Best product on the market as well. Yes there are competitors, like with any business/product, but Zillow is the most known. Some agents will buy from you for the simple fact that you’re calling from Zillow.","The culture of the Orange County office specifically has changed a lot in the last year. One of the core values is Orange County is a destination sales career. This is getting less true by the week. The Orange County office specifically is beginning to see an exodus of talent and employees who have worked with the company for a substantial amount of time. This isn’t a coincidence and over the past 6 months it’s gotten harder to ignore.  Loyalty is lost with Zillow. If you’re the #2 sales executive in the company you will still be let go if you don’t hit your quota for 3 consecutive months. It’s a very “what have you done for me lately” role...  But they will make exceptions for people they “like.” There have been instances where someone has missed quota for 3 months but an exception was made. Get on their good side.  One of the biggest things Zillow preaches is that you have to fit within the culture. They offer no movement for lateral mobility (in the sales executive role) unless you have consistently met your quota for a year or more. This is a little confusing because there are openings regularly in different departments. If Zillow truly only hires 1% of the people they interview and they deem them a cultural fit, wouldn’t it make sense to let them move into a role where they might succeed? Or at least give them the chance?","Management is fantastic and the people are better, but there have been too many aggressive changes since January. When you don’t offer loyalty to some of your most experienced sales executives (who have made the company a lot of money) you will continue to see people leaving this role for greener pastures. This company started off as a place I wanted to start my career with and quickly turned into a job. I’m not sure if it’s the aggressive financial goals for 2018 but clearly something is amiss when very senior employees are leaving. Go back to your roots, more and more it feels that Zillow is becoming a very standard, corporate, churn and burn kind of company."

My favorite perks/benefits are our desks that convert from sitting to standing at the push of a button, all the free snacks drinks and catered lunches, the gym reimbursement, 401k match, summer outing(we chartered a yacht for the day), holiday weekend(company flys all the employees out to Seattle for an awesome weekend), great health care....I could keep going but I think you get the point, it's awesome. My coworkers are all very self-driven so there is no need for micromanaging. The members of the executive team are all kind, down to earth and very intelligent. I have friends in the tech industry at other companies and when we compare cultures theirs just doesn't match up.

Spencer truly is a nice guy, and does care about the company. However, when it comes to integrity - the truth is you are an employee, a number, and while they want you to be loyal, it will not be returned. I had seen many great, hard-working people be manipulated and terminated, while some were allowed to walk on water.   2. When a class action wage lawsuit was brought against them, they did what any company would do - paid what they were told and not what they really owed, leaving out employees who should have included but were not named. Is this because they didn't have the money to pay everyone? I believe it comes down to bonuses and stock prices. Don't believe me, look up the executives salary and everyone else's. Yes, executives should be paid more, they have a lot of responsibility, but should that be 300 times more than you?   3. Stay long enough and peel behind the curtains. Hope you don't have to stand up for yourself because HR is not there to get your back, they are there to protect the mothership.  4. Pay has never been very high.

Yes, you may have a year of experience and being paid $10,000+ less than the guys and gals who haven't started yet.  5.

Of course you have to work HARD though, I honesty work less than 40 hours a week and sales managers don't mind.

Beyond the team ""morale"" activities, sponsored ski days, ping pong, Guitar Hero, and other activities, the people at Zillow are friendly and warm. Laughter is a sound heard almost daily. People enjoy working at Zillow.  Honest, approahcable leadership. The executive team is absolutely forthright about their decisions (and mistakes), the status of the company, and the direction moving forward. Furthermore, these honchos are down to Earth and easy to talk with. For example, the CEO sits on the floor during all-hand meetings and has even been known to kowtow in thanks for hard work. The company feels like one big team.","Hard economic times have especially affected start-ups like Zillow. Layoffs, the struggles to make profit in a down market, and the relentless pace of under-staffed development slowly sap the energy of a small company.  Because the company is still young, there are limited resources for salary increases or other incentives. Stock options can only entice so much effort.","Keep up the good work, but try not to do too much with too few resources. If you're not willing to employ more people don't stretch the current employees too thin. That will exhaust creativity and ultimately suffocate the amazing culture at the company."

No dress code, open office layout, free stocked cafeteria, weekly catered lunches, and fun off-site events are just a few of the non-traditional perks. They also have an awesome medical plan, stock options, and flexible PTO policy. You'll hear a lot of people mention ""culture"" as they talk about their experience at Zillow. That's because Zillow knows when you treat your employees well, THEY ACTUALLY ENJOY WORK! And we do. We have fun while growing a successful business. Senior management has the ship steered towards growth and their foot is on the gas.","Since Zillow hires rockstars, they want you to ROCK. Some might consider this challenge dead in the water. However, expectations are weighted on experience and skill level. If you set reasonable goals, they are achievable without being overly stressed.",Please don't stop. Don't get complaisant or settle.

The leadership team is great, I love the transparency Spencer and team provide the employees.","This isn't necessarily a negative, but there has been so much change in such a little amount of time and I would say if you are someone who doesn't adapt well to change, it might not be the place for you. We move very fast here and I don't see that changing any time soon. The pay could be a little more competitive, it's hard to move up or get promoted in certain positions. I've also seen a pretty big discrepancy in pay between Zillow and Trulia employees for the same role.",I think there needs to be a more clear path for employees to find their career path to move up in the organization. Lots of times I have only seen people get promoted when someone leaves and the position needs to be filled. I think the entry and mid level employees need a little more guidance on what the next steps/opportunities are for them. This could also help with keeping the turnover rate low. I think most employees would stay at such a great company if they could plan their future roles out a little bit.

Come up with ways to help sales associates feel less like they are in a cage. Give them the freedom to create their own schedule as long as they are hitting their numbers working their butts off and generating revenue. Really consider management roles and if the people moving into them are up for the task. The right manager for these teams can keep top performers from leaving the company and the wrong managers can ruin the entire company for employees who are passionate about the product and Zillow. Encourage employees to take a five minute walk outside to get fresh air. People will perform better and stay with the company. Prevent burn outs. Performances will increase if they feel they can take a lunch or step away from the phones for just five minutes believe it or not. Set the example that the client matters. Stop letting reps sell horrible zip codes just for the commission only to have an angry client down the road. Stop calling on the same agents who are not and never will be interested. Stop qualifying unqualified real estate agents. Stop letting poor sales representatives get away with lousy work and unethical customer service.

It all starts from very top from CEO all the way down to our floor leaders (managers)  Financial opportunity- The financial opportunities are endless. We sell one of the greatest products in the industry. If you work hard and smart compensations are generous.  Work culture- The thing I admire most about Zillow group is our work culture. This company puts its people first before anything, it truly believes that for it to continue to be an industry leader, it must treat its employees with respect, opportunity and growth and therefore it will attract the best talent around. Everything at Zillow group is about positivity, growth and professional development.  Benefits, perks, parties etc- We have great benefits.

People get stuck in positions that have no opportunity for meaningful learning that will position to apply for current full time positions and then you end up occupying a space which makes you feel like a second class citizen, even though allot of contract workers are there for over a year. Its difficult to be involved with such a cool place but know that you do not entirely belong and have to wait and hope for the best. This hurts morale and creates allot of difficult choices for employees who want to stay with the company but have little opportunity to transition to place of having decent pay, benefits and job security.",Keep doing what you are doing but make real plans to include contract workers into the main Zillow family when their work is needed and important.

Yes, Washington state is an at-will state, however it is human decency to not fire someone just because you disagree with them. While I was on the rentals team they fired several people with no cause or reason. When asked their response was, underperformance, however it never came up during the bi-monthly one-on-ones. Make sure HR is a safe place that people can go and talk to someone and not have it be used against them. I would suggest checking the stats to see how many people have been fired and for what reasons. It’s unfair to trust just the supervisor and think they know what’s best. You are losing great employees by assuming they are doing their job. Yes, I was fired and you can think I am a disgruntle employee, but that is not the case.

One of biggest cons I saw was for the contractors at Zillow. I started on a contract myself and it takes a long time to receive an offer to go full-time at Zillow. I would not deny that the 6 month contract is a great launching place but the lack of healthcare (many staffing companies have crappy or no benefits), the lack of job security, and the uncertainty about getting hired on is tough. Most of the contractors I spoke with shared my opinion. I saw so much great talent leave Zillow and find employment elsewhere after 10+ months because they weren't getting hired on and needed to make more money than the hourly rate that contractors receive after the agency takes a huge cut.  Great place to work but if you still have someone on your team after 6+ months, as a manager, you should be pushing to get them hired on. With the rate at which Zillow is hiring, why aren't contractors getting offers?",Budget in the potential offers you'll extend to contractors instead of citing that as the main reason you haven't gotten an offer after a long time.

It is high stress to hit your numbers and it doesn't take long to get fired if you aren't. I got burnt out very quickly.

At Zillow, there is so much camaraderie and support, each and every person WANTS you to succeed. The benefits are AMAZING and more importantly, the room for growth is substantial. The best part is upper management has all started as a sales rep. They know the ups and downs you go through so there is nothing that they can't help you with. Upper management asks for advice on how to improve and what the ""little guys"" want / are unhappy about and ALWAYS implement.   The CEO, CRO, Directors, Managers and all the Execs are the BEST professionals and people I have ever worked with. Period.","Like any sales job, the job is going to be TOUGH. Some people hate it because they are not cut out to be sales people. Period. You can not determine your role or how well you will do at the job for at least 6 months.

You will have to cold call people and get uncomfortable at times... i was fresh out of college when I started little over a year ago. The thing about this sales job is THE PRODUCT WORKS. There is nothing worse than selling a product you don't even believe in. We have THE BEST PRODUCT in the industry... how many people can say that?!? Once you see it work, the conviction in your conversations will sell itself. Most have the initial fear of failing because you have no book of business to work from. You have to start fresh and that is hard and scary... but every day gets easier and you will not have a better support system anywhere else.","Keep being transparent! You all do a great job of being very approachable and encouraging to be a culture carrier. I never feel like upper management is a tier of people who are intimidating and won't talk to you.

I made the jump to Zillow because my to-be manager told me in the interview that, ""everyone wants Zillow"" and we would dominate the market. Completely not true. Not only were our goals too high, but they were the same as every other market in the country. My market has one of the best conditions in the country, and it's completely unreasonable to be held to such high marks. On top of that, reps were able to sell wherever they want. I spoke to management a few times about reps selling in my territory, but it kept happening.  Outside of the day-to-day, the worst part of Zillow was interacting with my manager. He was unprofessional to a degree I have never experienced. We had weekly sales contests at the end of my tenure, and he did not allow me to participate in them, while other reps were able to. When I was let go, he didn't have the professional courtesy to tell me directly, but had his boss do it for him. Be a professional!!!",Take a look at your management.

I have always been a hard working, dedicated and driven employee. With that being said I had the pleasure of working for large retail and corporate organizations successfully for over 10 years. While i have been lucky to work for great companies in my past, none of them hold a candle to Zillow Group. Since i have worked here I have grew in both my professional and personal live. I have been able to build a nest egg in my savings account, buy a house, upgrade my car and travel. Professionally I have been developed from role to role under great leaders and could not be happier to get up in the morning and come to work and kick tail (a very rare thing a few of us lucky ones have the luxury of experiencing). Since the Zillow/Trulia merger, while I did feel the pain of being on the Trulia side of the business and returning to being a newbie on a large team I have continued to grow and learn and am in a ""Happy Place"" again (after a couple months of growing/transition pain).

For those of you who are just all about the perks, here are a few words. While the crazy amount and variety of snacks and drinks in the kitchen are not the reason I come to work everyday, I do very much appreciate a PBJ, Chips, Lattes, Peaches, Bananas and more... Our insurance (free by the way) is the best I have ever seen (remember I have worked for large corporations where good insurance has been my norm, ZG benefits are above and beyond). Our yearly reviews resulting in bonus RSUs/Options for our hard working employees are simply above and beyond. For the record I was not asked me to right this review, nor do I in anyway feel obligated to say random nice things about ZG. Truth is I sincerely believe in where I work, what we do and the people we help everyday.",Like I said above the Trulia/Zillow migration was a bit painful for a couple months.

But I am particularly impressed with how Zillow has created what most companies struggle most to achieve; humanity and humility at all levels of the company. The leadership culture of many, if not most, companies either originates with, or evolves over time into a self-protecting aristocracy. Leaders ride on the backs of, and take personal credit for the productive work of those they manage. They look out for 'threats' and protect their narrowly-defined turf. Ugh. It is so typical it is almost an office culture cliche. Not so Zillow. Zillow is a team sport. Throughout the C-suite, VPs and Directors there is an appreciation for 'collaboration' that goes well-beyond the lip service other companies pay to the concept. The CEO, CFO,CMO COO etc. do not have their own offices. They are readily available and view their respective roles as one part of an enterprise that is driven by the creativity of those they work with. This is a modern business, so there is a hierarchical reporting structure, but this traditional necessity is reluctantly superimposed on a culture ingrained with egalitarian meritocratic ideals. No matter what your official title, if you have an idea/concern/critique you express it...to whomever is in the room. Also, the founders, CEO and others in leadership positions clearly want to make Zillow as civil a work environment as they can while also encouraging a relentless drive for success (Core Value: Winning is Fun). It seems that their model for a successful company is realized through a supportive environment where individual risk taking does not equate to 'risking ones job' and proposing innovative ideas is not considered a way of 'sticking your neck out'. From my experience, tech companies that get all rigid with an unaccountable leadership class wither and die, or get blindsided by more agile, companies with non-hierarchical cultures...like Zillow. Zillow was conceived by civic minded, yet highly competitive innovators and savvy business people. The company culture is organized along these lines as well.","If you are seeking promotion through bluff, bluster, or office-scheming rather than through repeated demonstrations of your competence.

If you apply yourself, you'll go some where. Yes, office politics exist, but generally it's a meritocracy.","It's hard to write cons because I genuinely enjoy the company. But first off, if you're a recovering alcoholic, STAY AWAY, or have your sponsor on speed dial. Unsecured booze is in every corner of EVERY floor, stashed in closets, in every fridge with teams taking jellow shots in public kitchens. It's very hard to deal with in sobriety. Almost every event has booze, morale events are at bars, gifts are generally booze etc. Be firm in your sobriety or do not work here. Lastly, this is a company of affluent people, who are generally from affluent backgrounds. If you're from the poor side of things, and still have the chip on your shoulder, don't work here. Example, a room full of people (80+) laughing about someone being in prison. Disgusting. Often the experiences of the poor are mocked and minimized because hey, they can't buy houses.","Beware nepotism.

It's awesome to work on something as meaningful as empowering people to make better decisions about one of the most significant aspects of their lives. To do this with co-workers as smart, innovative and devoted as you'll find anywhere. To do this with one of the absolute best leadership teams around(just look at their track-records!). To be part of #1 -- the undisputed leader! -- in this space.

There are inherent challenges to this that we're not immune from and as much I trust we'll get through all of it just fine, ultimately, it can make for challenges here and there in the interim: clarity/ambiguity, communication, prioritization, culture, recruiting/talent, employee development, operational vs strategic, etc. Again, the typical challenges for a high-growth company so not necessarily unusual but certainly something that keeps us on our toes and can be distracting at times. Overall, though, I'll take all the goodness that comes from this growth since I trust we'll manage through the Change -- but it's never a given/guarantee and will require diligence, smarts and patience.  I'll also echo what others have said here that it sometimes would be nice to slow down a little bit, take a step back and attend to doing some things a little bit better versus rolling out more and more new stuff. It's the classic quality vs quantity/speed/TTM dilemma and I know it's a tough and core strategic challenge to figure out.","Keep the collaborative meritocracy alive. The Recruiting/talent bar high. Culture needs to be actively nurtured. Stay true to encouraging, demanding, outside-the-box thinking and expecting more than ""incremental"". Consumers are our North Star -- don't forget it!

To begin, everyone I met at Zillow was so friendly, welcoming, energetic and fun. In addition, they are some of the most intelligent and charismatic people you will ever meet. I had such a great time talking and working with all of them, that I had a extremely hard time leaving them at the end of my summer internship.  From that, the CEO, Spencer Rascoff, is a fantastic example of the bright minds and personalities found at Zillow. He is inspirational through his talks and the exceptional amount of work he puts into the company. And on top of that he is so approachable, friendly and open with employees about everything that is going on in the company and also always open to feedback to improve the company further.  Next, an aspect about Zillow that really stuck out to me was the great work/life balance they had there. People worked so hard at Zillow but overall everyone at the company understood that the life outside of work can be just as important. They also encouraged physical health through things like company-wide physical fitness competitions and having different sports groups formed by different employees.  Zillow also has such a unique place in the industry too. It is an innovative, unique, and growing company and continues to find new ways to help its users constantly. It is also a great size in terms of establishing itself quite well in the industry but also keeping that more personal and fun startup feel and energy.  Plus the experience and knowledge I gained from the internship was fantastic. I never found myself short of cool new things to work on. Also, the kinds of tasks I worked on varied so much and touched many aspects of the site. Overall I learned so much and loved the way the internship was set up for me by my manager.  Then with perks like free food, the Candy Wall, company trips, ZSpeakers, the location, and the gorgeous Seattle view, my experience at Zillow really was an outstanding.","I have no complaints. I really loved my experience. The only thing I can think of is that in the first couple of days I had a bit of a tough time ramping up to the kind of work I needed to do.

The reason why is simple, there is opportunity here. As a career salesman, I couldn't ask for a better company to represent and a better product to sell. I represent a company that is true to their ideals and takes employee satisfaction very seriously. I sell a product that can REALLY enhance a persons career potential and is a force that benefits millions across our great nation. As the company grows, I feel like I am growing with it. I love being involved in a company where there is so much innovation and change as time progresses. There is always another challenge and therefore, it never gets boring.   The reason I titled this ""The American Dream Realized"" is because Zillow has finally given me the platform and tools I have been looking for to start making a great living.

I could go on a tangent as to why, but in writing this review, I'll focus on what I believe is most pertinent to prospective applicants in case the reviews about catered food and free cold brew aren't doing it for you.    In a career search, most people look for key components when applying for a role: compensation package, benefits, career growth, work/life balance, and excitement about the company you work for. When considering these things on a scale of 1-10, Zillow is an 11.  When I first started, I had zero sales experience but was eager to learn and confident in myself. When I hit the sales floor, I initially struggled, but my team lead at the time spent much of his time developing and coaching me and got me to a point where I now consistently exceed and have more financial opportunity than I’ve ever had in my life. The point is, Zillow provides exceptional training on a daily basis, which positions anyone who takes it in for career growth and the best opportunity to be handsomely compensated. When it comes to work/life balance, I’ve never worked more than 40 hours a week, I’m encouraged to take vacations, and I occasionally take a Monday or Friday off just for fun. The benefits package is unreal and I’d bet you’ve never seen better. As far as excitement goes, Zillow is the largest, most innovative company in its space and the direction in which it’s heading is only going up.   I feel as though I’ve been taught invaluable lessons I’ll use my entire working life, that I’ve been given more opportunity than most any other company could give me, and most of all, I’ve truly been cared for at Zillow.","The sales role is definitely a grind and is not an easy job but nobody withholds that information from you prior to joining.

Since I have started the thing I say to anyone asking about the company is that, this is the only job I have ever had that you will work 7.5/ 7 hours out of an 8 hour work day... and they'll pay you well for it. As a salesperson that has had many salaried+commiss sales jobs is that it always turns out your pay is constantly being messed with. Working here in that capacity, they will pay you what you are worth, yes you'll work hard and you'll feel good about your work and they will pay you well for doing it! I cant ask for much more than that. It's a tech culture so you feel like you're being taken care of, great kitchen, snacks etc... but to me the most important thing is that you compensate me for the work you're asking of me and I can't stress how good it feels to be in a company that does just that.","Mid management politics suck at every company this size. The good thing is most of the managers have been here as reps prior to being a manager so they get the Zillow culture and live by it, outside management hired into the culture tend to not buy into so much, so it can be difficult as a seasoned rep here to deal with the politics that usually comes from management hired from outside the family. Keep your head down and create your destiny here.","Outside management doesn't get our culture, hire more and train more from within which helps bolster our culture which all of our reps love to embrace. The breakdown is in mid management that hasn't bought into how to manage and retain top talent in this culture. Mostly it seems they just want to churn and burn reps like most other sales companies do. I hope we can avoid this."

The job is simple however the demographic you are reaching out to is complex (to say the least). The class was comprehensive and I felt excited to get on the phones and start making dollars. When I got out there and got past the first sale (which is usually the hardest) I saw what was possible. If you’re not in sales for money or recognition, you are in the wrong field. This company does a hell of a lot of both. I have always had an above average work ethic and found myself struggling with expectations but the fact of the matter is; more production, more results. I made exceptional money while at Zillow and couldn’t have been happier with the transparency of the management. I parted ways with Zillow because of timing. Had I been 5 years younger this would have been perfect. When I expressed concern to my manager he understood and we separated on good terms with him even agreeing to be used as a reference. The HR department was expeditious with everything and the exit interview was sad. Sad because working alongside such positive and innovative people was enlightening and I knew I was going to miss that. And I do.","The expectations are rigorous. If you cannot handle them, bail. People hang in with the notion that these standards will decrease at some point. I assure you, they will not. If you cannot commit to working insane hours to accomplish your goal, bail. Going into this I was told very clearly what was needed to be done to stay within compliance. These are not scare tactics, motivational exaggerations or jokes. Be prepared to work with real estate agents all day. If you would like, pick up your cell phone and try to take 15 minutes of an agents time. If you can do that in 50 calls, you may have a shot at succeeding in this job. If you do not have the skin-thickness of a WWII leatherneck Marine charging a beach on Iwo Jima, bail.

LEADERSHIP: Anyone in real estate knows the 3 golden rules for success which is location, location and location. In my opinion the 3 golden rules for corporate success is leadership, leadership, leadership. If I ever quit Zillow, they have switched up how I would search for a new job. The first thing I would investigate is the leaderships track record and let's be honest Zillow's leadership is about as good as it gets. Spencer's natural charisma and knack for leadership gets two thumbs up from me. Don't get me wrong I know Zillow is a Team Sport and we have hundred's, actually thousands of very talented people but I believe the top executives are responsible for the long term growth.   COMPENSATION: All and all Zillow's compensation is fair. You can definitely make really good money but be ready to grind you tail off, lucky for me I don't mind. When you throw in all the company functions, health benefits, 401K match, bonuses, regular hosted lunches, bus pass, PassPort card and much more, Zillow makes it worth it to work 10-12 days.  WORK ENVIRONMENT: If you are a person that has high energy, likes loud music, likes wearing relaxed attire, competitive nature, likes to play video game at break time, working in a beautiful high profile modern building, watching the sunrise from behind Mt Rainer or watching the whales swim by at sunset in the Puget Sound........you might want to apply at Zillow",Only a couple negative ones....   I've been here for just under 5 years and personally had issues that really started to surface after we went public which I suppose typically happens. My main issues were pay related because I was hired on at certain splits and then one day they just announce they are changing it. It seems to change up a few times a year now. It's not always in the same form but they are always trying a way to push us harder to get the dangling carrot. I get it that it's good for the Zillow bottom line but it burns people out pretty quickly and ultimately provides lower level customer service to clients because we are pushed to bring on more new clients over anything else. It's an endless circle.  We are so big now and unless you are a person that likes to schmooze you can often feel like your efforts go unnoticed. If you are single with no kids it's much easier to advance because you can participate in all the after work functions.  I feel trapped in my position because I don't feel like I can make as much money in a different position within the company.,"You guys are the Rock Stars, how about some advice to me?"

I've never worked for a company that had such an open door policy before.   I'm in Sales and what I love is that you really are rewarded for how much work you put in. Your commission isn't limited, so just keep selling and you'll keep making more money and let me tell you - the pay compensation is very fair.   In addition to your salary and commission, there are also constant contests. I've won cash prizes ranging from $25 to $1,000, gift cards, remote control cars, a blackjack visor, a macbook, and that's just what I have personally won!  The benefits are Amazing! Phenomenal health insurance, free public transit, an amazing office in the heart of Downtown Seattle with beautiful panoramic views, a video game room, shuffleboard. Ping pong, Foose ball, 3 break rooms/dining areas, a frozen yogurt machine, several catered lunches a month, the craziest holiday parties I've ever been to, and more!   I also love that they reward you for selling the right way, or as we call it the 'Zillow Way'. They consistently give out bonuses to the reps with the lowest cancel rates (ensuring they are bringing on new business in the right way with clear expectations) and you also lose commission if your sale cancels it soon after buying. This may seem bad,but it's really not and is just to make sure you aren't 'Selling hot' or putting someone in a bad position.   I love the fact that I only have to sell to one group of people (Real Estate Agents) and I'm selling the UNQUESTIONABLY BEST marketing product in their industry. Seriously how much easier can it get?   If you can't CRUSH this job, you don't belong in Sales. Period.","Now for the Cons. If the benefits, management, pay, and work environment are all awesome then there can't be a downside right? Wrong.   It is a grind! If you aren't prepared to work your butt off, then don't bother. They want the best, they hire the best, they provide the best tools, and if you don't give your best ... well then they don't want you. This job is all about the numbers and not getting beat down after your 30th hangup of the day. The next sale could always be 1 call away and if you don't go in to every single call with the mentality then you are limiting yourself.","My only advice to upper management is to PLEASE Ask,listen, and heed the advice of your general managers and managers on the Sales side. There are occasionally decisions made that seem reactive to some metrics and ehile the idea may look and sound good on paper, but just doesn't translate the same way on/to the sales floor."

You learn quickly how to multi task or be a part of 4 different conversations at once. Surrounded by all personality types. I don't know how I could go back to working in a boring office, I don't think I could. Lots of events and food around all the time. Unlimited motivation. And not the type where it's all about revenue goals either. Any win is celebrated, especially doing right by your client. The hours are great. If you come in early you can leave early. Even though your manager is right by you and checks in with you all day, you're not feeling micro managed.. Which sounds weird but it's true. The expectations are fair. And transparent. In my old sales roles I felt like my 1 on 1's consisted of both parties BS-ing their way through the conversation. They really care about your personal growth here. And will take you step by step to get there. If you're willing to put the work in. Also- the pay is amazing. If someone tells you otherwise it's because they aren't hitting attainable goals set and may not be cut out for sales.","You have to be okay with being on the phone ALL day. It's fast pace and you are expected to manage a pretty big book of business. I would imagine this will get better with time, but I do feel like I get stuck with customer service issues that shouldn't be my responsibility to deal with. We need more support in that department. The turn around time for a simple customer service request is way too long. Online marketing and real estate in general are ever changing industries so combining the two it's to be expected...but dealing with the reactions of our clients every time our product changes or restructures in any way can be exhausting. But it comes with the territory and as long as you believe in the product, like I do, then you will find a way to keep things positive and remind your client you're here to help them grow their business.",I think there should be a very clear path for advancement and a transparency of what other departments there are so that if someone is an awesome culture fit but would be better suited in a different role that it would be an option for them.

I know what my team needs to do we can usually get it done without spending ages talking and coordinating with other teams.   Company Vision - Management does a good job of communicating where the company is going both in the next months and years and make it clear how everyone fits into that plan and how their work contributes to that goal.   Ownership - I don't know anyone at Zillow who feels their job isn't important, or as a joke goes is responsible for polishing the print button, everyone can get enough responsibility to push themselves to the limit.   Opportunities for growth - My manager sincerely cares about my success and helps identify ways for me to improve and grow. I feel that my career has accelerated since I've joined Zillow.  Company culture - I can tell that everyone I work with wants to be there and cares about their job and the success of the company. Working in a place like this is inspiring and pushes me to perform better.  Benefits & Pay - Zillow benefits and pay have become more competitive over the last few years. It's especially good if you're bullish on the stock, because bonuses are still paid in stock options. Also, as of today there's a discretionary time off policy which means you can take as much time off as you see fit.   Work/Life Balance - many people I know work 40-50 hours per week and are successful. There's no pressure to work overtime unless there's an exceptional business need.   Office - The office in downtown Seattle is amazing. Great views, standing desks, snacks, coffee & espresso machines, and weekly yoga.","Stock Options - depending on when you got your stock and when you plan to cash it in these can work against you compared to how you're paid at other big companies. I think this is a good con and filters for the right people. Change/Growth - Zillow is growing quickly and so far has managed to deal with the larger size well, but this is always going to be a risk. It's no longer a start-up.","Keep doing what you're doing.

The company takes care of their people. Its not just a thing that they say either, they really do. From fantastic benefits to constant availability of snacks and food, they really want their people to be happy (happy employees make good employees). They go above and beyond what they need to be doing to ensure that everyone has a good working environment. I've only ever met really great people in management, and they really are, not only open to, but encouraging of movement and growth. They want you to explore different roles in the company and keep learning. Work life balance is great, I don't feel like I have to take work home or stay later than I'm supposed to .","Although work life balance is great, the nature of the company (nationwide real estate) there is a necessity for some people in departments to have a schedule that forces them to be in the office either early in the morning, or later in the day, and on weekends. Not the end of the world, but its definitely not a conventional schedule. The pay is good, but its just enough, I'm not going to be building a huge savings account with it (although with annual reviews, your salary is part of that and can go up). The snacks don't rotate very much, so you do get tired of them (but, oh darn, free snacks, amirite). There also sometimes feels as though there aren't perfect lines of communication between, not only offices, but sometimes departments. Things change very fast and sometimes it's hard to know exactly what should be happening or if the people in charge know what's going on. It's a big company with a lot of offices, so its hard to feel totally connected to all of them (the collective holiday party in Seattle definitely helps though).","Keep doing what you're doing, and don't forget about your people, even in the small roles (not that you do).

This company is pretty unique in the degree to which everyone can know what's going on and how we're doing.","Things move fast -- you have to be comfortable living with the foot on the gas. As start-ups go, this is run as a survivable business. We're not on a forced march to IPO, leaving bodies along the path -- we have fun, people can take vacations. The people need to work long hours with some regularity, as we ship a lot of stuff, but certainly not every day.   The culture is straightforward, which can feel blunt and even harsh. Personally, I appreciate a culture where everyone (at every rung of the ladder) can say what they think -- as long as they back it up with data or rationale. There is little beating around the bush, which means things get done faster. Sometimes the bluntness involves less tact than it could, but hey this is a tech company.","Focus on developing mid managers, and helping mid managers train and develop their reports.

There's an open floor plan with floor to ceiling windows that allow tons of natural light in and provide fantastic views! Since working at Zillow, I've been able to catch an awesome sunset over Puget Sound almost every evening.   The provided facilities are great! I love the open kitchens with free snacks and Puget Sound facing windows (better to catch the views!). The Ping Pong, Shuffle Board, Air Hockey and Xbox room are awesome! It's really nice to have an area to unwind in after work or during a quick break. Oh man, and the candy wall! Great addition. I think it's one of those things you love from the beginning but move away from due to the repeated sugar overdoses...but the cool factor still remains :) !   I'm also a huge fan of the free food that's provided and the Zspeakers! It's such a cool experience to hear these people tell their stories and also have the chance to speak with them afterwards.   I really love working with my team as well! Everyday is a lot of fun with hilarious humor, support and interesting work. When I joined, everyone was incredibly welcoming and really helped teach me the ropes. Everyday is still the same now and I love going into work!  The benefits and compensation are really great as well! They provide 100% coverage for Medical, Dental, Prescription and Vision and finding that set up is pretty challenging I think. So I really appreciated that! On top of that, I think that the pay is great. It fully meets my needs as a single male. Then there's paid time off, sick leave and some more. So all around, I think it's a great set up.   Oh! There's also the free bus pass! If you have a car then eh, but if you don't (me) then YAY! Paying for the bus before was really annoying, so getting a free bus pass was awesome.   I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting at the moment. All in all, I really enjoy working at Zillow. I think it's a really fun company, fun people, lively (depending on what floor you're on), great location, great amenities, great CEO and more.","Nothing really. As with any company that becomes large I think that communication and ease of movement are areas for potential improvement. However, I think that's to be expected and I'm aware that Spencer keeps a sharp eye out for those areas and keeps his door open to suggestions on improvements.   Spencer's personal transparency and provided availability are really great! Particularly since the company is so big, I think the amount of availability and transparency from Spencer is really impressive. I actually got to see and hear from Spencer within my first week of working at Zillow! That was cool. At some point I'll say hi.   Overall, I really don't think there are any cons. Like I said, for the things that could be cons, Spencer and others do a great job keeping an awareness around them and then providing you an outlet to bring those things up.","I don't have any advice for management. I think they're great. During the first month we had a big increase in work load since some folks went on vacation and I was still learning. So, I made the decision to put in some long hours to try and keep things up to date. My boss, and his boss, made note of it and took me out to lunch as a thank you. I really appreciated that! I think they keep a good eye out for you and check in to make sure you're doing well. "

I enjoy being part of a team that provides meaningful data, embraces technology and focuses on the consumer experience. The Zillow Group is a brand that I trust and feel good about representing.  I'm on the rentals team and I like the substance we're bringing to the multi-family housing industry. We operate with a fraction of the people compared to our competitors and according to the April and May comScore data we rank as #1 for amount of rentals traffic to our websites. It's awesome that we operate lean and yet have the highest number of consumers searching on our network for a place to rent. Paying consumers also appreciate this because it helps control advertising cost.  A side note... Prior to joining the Zillow Group I was a client. The contacts they delivered to my leasing teams were quality, the service superior and return on investment was my lowest cost per lease for a paid advertising source. Now that I'm part of the Zillow team it makes my day when I hear this type of feedback from customers.  I hope this employment review helps anyone considering joining the Zillow Group!  PS Yes, expectations are high however they are also realistic!",The biggest challenges I've experienced in the rentals division is clear communication and sometimes putting the cart before the horse.

Don't let the negative reviews scare you away from applying here. The negative reviews are from more tenured reps who I assume are getting too comfortable with their career and might be feeling pressure from management because of it and can't handle the pressure (this is a sales gig at the number one online Real Estate company with very large goals, what do you expect).   If you get offered the job, you are very fortunate, and you won't regret accepting it. As a new hire (sales exec), there hasn't been any surprises or anything that made me think the slightest bit ""oh, wow this company really is on the decline"" like how some reviews make it seem. The product truly is amazing and it sells as long as you listen and learn from those who consistently hit 200-250+% quota (many people do). Quotas are not unrealistic at all, and basically almost everyone hits at least 100% of their quota every month, unlike at any other sales gig I've had. And Zillow Group just crushed their quarterly earnings report (hence, why the company isn't on the decline).   To the tenured reps who say Zillow isn't what it used to be, maybe you're right and maybe it did have a few perks or commission structure changes or whatever... but all I can say is, as a new hire, I don't see how you can't still be happy with what you've got. I feel spoiled here. And I definitely feel like Zillow cares about me and my colleagues more than any other company I've ever worked for, from the CEO down. And I am motivated to perform well not only because I can make a ton of money here, but also because I don't ever want to jeopardize losing such an amazing job with the number one Real Estate company with so many awesome people around me.   Benefits are amazing as well... That's an understatement.","There isn't really a possibility to work from home... That would be a nice privilege.   I see negative reviews about the PAC side, but the few PAC employees I've met do not seem unhappy at all. Take your job seriously, stay away from negative people, and you'll be happy here.",I don't feel micromanaged like how some other reviews may indicate (maybe i got lucky?). I guess my advice would be to continue not micromanaging.

While many of these reviews offer valid points that are indeed true, they lose credibility from what can be construed as a disgruntled former employee fired for non-performance. I'd like to offer a perspective as a seasoned sales rep, with 10+ years experience, who also left a great job to join the Zillow team, who agrees there are issues at Zillow, yet also still wants a future on the Zillow Rentals team. I'm one of the reps that has been at Zillow the longest, and I have a history of high sales performance. As for the pros, I'll firstly agree with almost every other review in saying that the 401k and benefits are stellar. The medical insurance even covers infertility treatments, which is almost unheard of. Zillow culture is awesome, and a huge point of effort on the CEO's part. That being said, I work in-market, and it doesn't translate (not sure how they could do this, in truth.)","The rentals org is a mess. Accounts are constantly fought over and moved to new reps, causing annoyance to our clients. The account management team is in constant battle with the sales team because there are no clear cut rules on either side. I've personally asked our sales trainer for specific group training as a group several times, with no such training in the works. I agree that Zillow offers poor training, the cause of that being they have no real idea where they're going or even what they want it to look like. One thing this team does have is TREMENDOUS potential. I believe the leadership in place can indeed get is there, especially the two mentioned in a previous review. One of which does have an extensive background in Sales, and has built highly successful organizations. Changes need to be made, there is no doubt. No one wants to work in fear all of the time, and eventually the real talent will leave with that atmosphere. No one wants to be treated like a number, and one person in leadership in particular treats us like we are nothing more than his personal cash cows. Although, that same person in leadership has a brilliant mind for operations and will be a great leader if he learns how to have a heart. He is a definite asset to Zillow, and will grow to be an even greater one of he treats his employees like assets. There is so much potential here, and I personally plan to play it out until they tell me I can't anymore. This team will be great, with some changes.","Get to know your team. You're sitting on a team with tremendous talent, and wasting it. We are people, good people at that....and more than just what our numbers reflect on a board. You've given us no motivation to want to work for you, other than financial. Get to know us and our individual strengths and then use them. The missing factor is not in protocol, or organizational setup, or in new teams.....the missing factor is HEART. Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character.

They will railroad you if you are sick and expect that you work anyway.   You will sell terrible advertising packages because you have a quota to hit. You know its not worth what it costs but you'll sell it anyway. (This is a flaw because the product can work well when sold correctly)",The OC office needs an influx of culture from Seattle - you can have fun and still remain professional. OC hasn't found that balance.

As a CES, I was consistently on our daily leader board and felt a drive to push myself due to an unparalleled work-place culture. Truly felt appreciated as an employee for a multitude of reasons; free food didn't hurt. My co-workers and managers both were beyond influential in helping me receive the highest possible bonus you could in our department for every quarterly review conducted on my behalf. I worked hard and build solid rapport with almost everyone in the Denver office. It is incredibly unfortunate that I'm even having to type the duration of this review out, but it needs to be heard.","There really aren't any cons to working at the Denver office, minus the deplorable comments and actions of an individual who single-handedly brings down the morale of almost 200 people on a daily basis. The statements are reprehensible, I was told in order to succeed at this company, I'd have to ""fake it until you make it."" That deplorable mentality carries over to a truly vile managerial style that does nothing but promote unnecessary micro-management that invalidates efforts done by members on the team, myself included. Which only succeeded in making me feel inadequate and like I was not a valued member of the office. Constant complaints are mustered against this individual to no avail and this imperviousness is a true mystery. This individual personally led me to have overwhelmingly debilitating panic attacks on an almost daily basis which eventually caused my numbers to fall, for me to be forced to leave my desk and sometimes even have to leave early. This was then used against me in order to justify my termination. Multiple co-workers and leads were aware of the situation and but by then, it was too late. It pains me to write all this out and make it public knowledge, but it needs to be seen and heard, not swept under the rug like the company would prefer.",You are all wonderful human-beings and it was a pleasure getting to work alongside you.

You can get to know your colleagues well (in engineering at least) because people tend to stick around.  - The company really trusts engineers. Design decisions are made by stack owners with little scrutiny from the business side. None of that absurd ""frugality"" business standing in the way. It's almost unprecedented for a company of this size to have so much faith in their engineers to drive the stack however they choose.  - The culture is really laid back. If you can get all your work done (and do a great job), then you're absolutely free to play ping pong for four hours, which is great because this is how some people work most effectively.  - The culture is passionate. Some of the most treasured moments in my career so far have been sitting, drinking and talking about the architecture of services late into the night with ops. We'd also find ourselves after-hours on a Friday evening huddled around, looking at property listings and talking about all the renovations we'd do if we bought that house. Zillow loves technology, and loves houses. It's remarkable how much you grow professionally in an environment where people will talk anyone's ear off for hours about non relational databases.  - VPs and executives are so accessible. They make the effort to be available for communication, and even when they're spread thin, they take the time to at least try to address any issues you may come to them with. It's not the company it was five years ago, and they are no longer the people they were five years (in terms of demands on time and responsibility, at least), but they always try their hardest to remain human, which is nice.","- The risk of being blocked is high at all software companies, but it would happen for sometimes weeks on end at Zillow, due to a slight perversion of ill-defined ""core values"". People would break tools that the entire org depended on, shipping untested messes behind the smokescreen of ""move fast, think big"". Maybe it should be modified to ""move fast, think big, be considerate, write unit tests""?  - There's a growing problem of feeling generally less effective and less gratified. Four years ago we just sat down, designed and built features, and shipped 100% of what we wrote. Due to growth/ineffective project management/blocking issues, our velocity wasn't where I'd become to accustomed to by the time I left. I loved Zillow, but what really crushed me before I left was being told that things I'd been asked to work on wouldn't be shipping because they'd been ""deprioritized"". That is soul-crushing.  - Zillow has a serious diversity problem. Everywhere does, but Zillow seems more reluctant than other places to acknowledge and work on it. None of the senior leadership are people of color, and they all came from very similar backgrounds. Zillow execs, VPs and ESPECIALLY HR are very out-of-touch with the experiences and needs of employees of color (and women, and people who identify as LGBT, and pretty much any other sensitive, lawsuity area), and often say and do very offensive things without realizing it.  - There are some management issues. Management is often untrained in dealing with people, and unequipped to fix issues before they get out of hand. It seemed like employee needs were sometimes dismissed or ignored until they reached the point of lowering morale.","- Obviously growth can be difficult, but it's irritating to read reviews here saying, ""If you're a person who hates change, maybe you're not cut out for Zillow!"" That's sycophantic. The onus is on leadership to make transitions go as smoothly as possible for employees and I feel that Zillow sometimes doesn't meet standards in this respect. ""Own it"" is good and fine, but we should also just be free to actually do the things within our job descriptions without worrying about having to do everyone else's job all the time."

They dangle leadership advancement carrots in front of you to try and keep you as the robot you are. No fun is allowed in the department, it's widely known as one of the worst departments to be in. They have no morale or team bonding events. Zillow encourages managers to take their teams out to bond and do happy hours, but they still don't.

Back in 2013 and 2014 I had a few great managers that helped my growth. From 2015 on the managers I had were a mix of horrible, pathetic, and okay. More on that in the cons section.  - Sweet office (in Seattle) and I was friends with a ton of co-workers. That was one of the only things that kept me coming in my last couple years. The close friends I had and got to see everyday (sometimes the bond was really strengthened out of our disdain for management), the views to enjoy every day, the plethora of free snacks and coffee. That was all great! - Zillow is a fairly important company in the tech world. It was exciting to be involved in something that had such a large reach. - Travel (depending on the department) really was enjoyable and helped break up the mundane Monday through Friday.  There are enough Pros to make this company worth consideration for employment. I can't in good conscience say it's a bad company - it's a company that used to be really fun and pretty great, and has slowly sunk into mediocrity and isn't very fun anymore. The last few months I found myself consistently not wanting to get off the elevator and put in another 8, or should I say 9+, hours.   If you are considering working at Zillow, be sure to read some of the negative reviews too and think about working in that environment. I'm not saying don't do it, I just want to encourage you to have done your homework - it's not all sunshine and daisies like most people will lead you to believe.","Where do I even start?   Why don't I start with my co-workers that got fired for made up reasons just to get rid of them. You better be careful about being an employee that works hard, performs at or above average, and asks management the tough questions in an effort to try improving the company or department. You will be viewed by management as a problem, someone that ""questions"" them and ultimately as someone to get rid of. Since I've left I've heard of this happening to a few other colleagues of mine that were fine employees. Zillow encourages employees to provide feedback, but what they should really say is ""you can share your ideas with us but we're going to say no because we know better, and if you continue to bring up your recommendations you may not ever have the chance for giving that feedback again."" It's mind boggling how a company does this. A lot of the employees that write positive reviews are just blind to these firings - and to Zillow's ""credit"" they do a great job of hiding it.  For most of my tenure I was on a thriving and growing department of about 40 people and then it was quickly run into the ground - and actually cut entirely - by the actions of the most unprofessional management group you can ever imagine. A few years ago about half of the management team was inherited from a merger, and they were what drove this department into the ground. There's no point in giving further details, my point is that I can't believe upper management allowed this to take place. Simply pathetic. The whole way through this downward slide I was consistently vocal that things should be going the opposite direction. I had numerous colleagues thank me for being the one that spoke out, however, management told me I was a ""problem"" and on more than one occasion wanted me to apologize - I didn't. I'm confident I wasn't further reprimanded since I was a top producer. I eventually left that department (before it got cut) because I got sick of being treated like a child. It didn't get a whole lot better in the next department as I continued to be treated as junior level employee, and not like someone that had been with the company for half a decade.  Another major reason that I left Zillow was that when I transferred departments (from Onboarding to Premier Broker), going into a more difficult and important role, I was asked to take a $12,000 annual pay cut. No commissions I'm hiding to throw off the numbers - this was a legitimate huge pay cut. Oh, we were promised that we would be getting at least some sort of bonuses starting later in the year, but that didn't happen and that's a whole other story. None of us believed the bonuses would actually happen, we knew it was just more deceit and lies from management in an effort to string us along, again. Anyways, when I poked and prodded about the proposed pay cut it was explained that this was in an effort to minimize the gender pay gap. I was told that Zillow was going to start putting people at the same pay when they joined a department regardless of their seniority, tenure, etc. to make sure that men and women were not paid differently. Keep in mind, this was shortly after Zillow reported that they paid women $1.01 to every $1.00 that men make. In the end management agreed to meet me halfway, so I decided to take a fairly healthy pay cut in the name of equality.  You can see why I left, can't you?  I've seen so many grievances take place against my co-workers that I couldn't even begin to list all of them; I would be typing this review for the rest of the day. I suppose some mismanagement is to be expected in any quickly growing tech company, but it's hard to imagine it being much worse than it is at Zillow. Don't even get me started on some of the problems in Denver too, holy cow is that office completely out of hand on so many levels. The stories I could tell. Wow.  In my last year or two we were expected to essentially be robots, just repeating the script we were given. We were highly encouraged to make up client success stories that fit the narrative of that ""call script"". I always told management ""No. Absolutely Not."" to these approaches, and you know what's ironic? I was considered one of the best client coaches - even though I would consistently go outside of my lane. It was a running joke among my colleagues that we should just record our coaching calls, push play when we got the client on the phone, and that would be the best way to appease management. Unbelievable.   An astonishing number of very successful employees have left Zillow in the last year or so. A lot of people have finally had enough.  I could go on about numerous other issues that Zillow has, but I'll stop there.",Now that I'm outside of the company maybe management will actually listen to me.

Zillow,Z, WA,Seattle,"June 14, 2018",,(6),4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5.0,4.0,Former,,,,, Client Engagement Specialist,"Recommends, Positive Outlook, Approves of CEO",full time,,,More than a year,,,,,"I want to start by saying I WISH I could give Zillow 5 stars, but the way PAC is treated and a few other things really bring it down to 4.   Now down to the real pros and cons:   - AMAZING Culture. Truly one of a kind and I believe the company lives and breathes the values.  -Benefits are top notch. Healthcare, dental, vision, snacks, stock, competitive/above average pay, 401k match, games, occasional catered lunch, etc. Think of the most stereotypical Silicon Valley company (In a good way :) ) and you've got Zillow.   - Incredible technology and innovation. Zillow is THE #1 site when it comes to real estate. Zillow is 10 steps ahead of the competition and I’m excited to see where they go next.   -Changing behavior - Some people may see this as a con, but the company is in a constant state of flux. They are changing people's behavior (Potential home buyers/sellers, agents, loan officers, landlords, etc.) and it was fun to be a part of, but you need to be okay with change.","- Internal mobility is an absolute mess. This is one of the main reasons I left the company. I applied for a job after being with the company for 2 years and was quite literally “forgotten” about until a Sr. Manger pinged the internal mobility recruiter- I received a formal apology, but it was really hurtful.  ------As a follow up to this internal mobility, all Denver hires should be aware that the majority of the Denver office (80-90%) is sales and customer service. If you want to move up in those departments it's a great opportunity, or if you want to stick it out for a year, get to understand the company and culture, etc. you can transfer to another office after a year.   - It's mostly a joke within the company, but PAC or Premier Agent Concierge (The entry level department a large number join into as an associate CES) is the red headed step child of the company. We work 363 days out of the year until 8 PM, 7 days a week(Holidays included) and other departments pity our department/consider it a joke. It's ridiculous that PAC still is expected to ""thank"" management when we were allowed to participate in entire company events.  -----This has gotten A LOT better since I started in early 2016, but there is still a long way to go  -Management communication (especially in PAC). When news comes out, it instantly turns in to a game of telephone with some team leads/associate managers saying one thing, while others say another. One SOP changes and some say follow it, others say do whatever you want. There were a couple times when we had LARGE meetings where EVERYONE got the exact same information- I think this needs to be more frequent and a standard practice to reduce this chatter and try to nip the ""Zumor mill rumors"" before they bud.",-Internal mobility. This needs to have massive oversight and accountability. 2 people are not even close to enough to handle this.

All of your medical is paid for, and they also give you an ORCA card so you can get downtown. Great atmosphere. They keep the kitchen stocked with good food, and you occasionally get free lunch from a catering company. Most of the people there are cool.","Their turnover rate is super high for inside sales, and they kinda dont like to talk about it. Of the 12 people in my training class, 1/2 of them quit within 2 months. We had a really great trainer, and we also had a really bad trainer. She would shush people like she was putting a niece in check, and I always wondered why none of her superiors ever addressed her on how unprofessional she was.   They do give you free lunches often, but you pretty much eat them at your desk because they really frown on someone actually taking a lunch break. One of my fellow classmates was asked if he was ok because he took a 45 minute lunch once.    They want you to be over 210 minutes on the phone each day which is arbitrary if your making sales. Ive seen and overheard plenty of top sales people barely pick up a phone all day or go over an hour on the phone. They do threaten to take away your inbound calls or emails if you dont meet your time quota, which will ultimately make it harder to make more sales.  Everything is transparent so you can see peoples sales, minutes and call time anytime you want. They want people to be competitive and make that hot sale. Which is the opposite of what the CEO preaches. We were told to respect that we are asking for real estate agents hard earned money, but when they listen to your calls and critique you for not making a one call close, it makes you wonder what really is the quality of the relationship to the customer.   Lastly, taking time off is not the best thing to do. It's highly frowned upon, because if your on vacation your not at your desk making sales. End of the month is especially a big NO NO. If your a top earner....your chances probably improve a little.","They love to say how transparent they are.....but they really aren't. Be more real about your expectations with your incoming class. This job is an emotional roller coaster. When you sell your on a high, and when you ....it feels like a wasted day. If your not selling hot like some of the other salespeople, your gonna be critiqued for one thing or another."

Good money can be made. Loved helping Real Estate Agents in changing their lives for the better by driving new business their way. You go home feeling great about what you did for others. Sure you work hard make allot of calls but the rewards are worth it and the work you put into it. They treat you with wonderful incentives like free lunches, snacks, drinks, great company rallies, and motivate you to be your best.","Even if you are making your quota, call time and have a great retention rate with your clients, its not enough to keep your job. I really loved my job, but if you upset the wrong manager you are gone, I watched this manager let go great people with great potential over the fact the manager just did not like the person, its a well known fact and spoke about often. If you kiss butt and make that manager feel good about themselves you are golden, If you come in do your job and do not wish to participate in being a cheerleader, then walk away now. I was in extreme fear if I brought this up I would have lost my job. Instead I put my head down and did my job. I took pride in my job, loved my agents and excited about what Zillow's future had for all of us. Upper management may or may not be aware of this, a real shame if they do. I would have stayed with this company forever and continued to exceed my numbers and help the company grow. Knowing that one persons opinion of you can change your whole life is extremely sad.","Pay attention to the managers turn over. Question why sales people who are exceeding goals were really let go, look at the big picture with the situation and see if there reasoning makes true sense.

The location is good too, they have free parking and it is across the street from Top Golf.","The premier agent concierge department is just a little bit of a mess. When I was hired I thought it was going to be a lot different then it was. This position is basically telemarketing without the sales, you are harassing people all day just dialing nonstop getting hung up on and berated. When someone reaches out to a realtor in this program they are expecting that realtor to call them but instead you do and try to schedule a time for them to speak. It's good for busy agents who don't want to deal with bad leads like rentals but it frustrates consumers, it's really hard to feel good about what you're doing either.   Management is very inexperienced and young which can make your day tough as well, the average age of our leadership team is probably 25 I would guess. For many of them this is their first job so they don't have a lot of real world management skills, they resort to micromanaging a lot. It started out as a fun environment but as time went on they have implemented more and more rules like no cellphones, no wearing shorts, no talking with each other at your desk, ect it feels a lot like highschool now. That's really all your manager or lead will be there for, watching you to make sure you're not texting. They can be very disrespectful too, it's definitely not a team relationship it's more us verse them. They don't have any sort of performance improvement plan either, if your numbers are bad they'll just give you the cold shoulder and not say hi in the hallway and stuff like that. It sounds really childish but again, it's a really inexperienced management team.   The job itself breaks a lot of people just like telemarketing does too. In a typical day I'll make 200 dials. Since the job is so easy there is no advantage to people who have been there longer, it all comes to how many dials you can make in a day. New hires come in and do really well because it's new and they are optimistic, this position takes no skill or learning either just dial. After a few months though and realizing advancement wont happen you will be worn down and the thought of even making another call is tough. As soon as your numbers start to fall management will treat you very poorly. That's how the cycle has gone since I've been here, they have lost most of what I would consider their bright employees because of this. This creates a really odd environment too, about half of the floor is completely negative about everyone and everything here and talking openly about looking for another job.   The advancement opportunities are not good either, this also creates a lot of the tension. This team has almost 200 people and many of us hired on wanting to advance here. They really sell you on that but they prefer to hire from outside rather than promote from within.   Overall it's not a horrible job, the pay is really good for what it is and the benefits are nice as well. Definitely don't look at it as a career though, most people make it about 3 months before they start looking for something else. Management is really inexperienced and poor and it will feel a lot like high school but as long as you can handle that you can get by until you find something better.","Treat your employees with a little more respect, you may be surprised by the results."

The drug culture is out of control, even reaching into management level. I have been in the office when someone came in stinking of marijuana. I have seen another rep come in from lunch with a white ring around his nose. If I had a 20-something son or daughter I wouldn't want them to work here simply because it's easy to get caught up in that culture. pill popping is not uncommon at all. I have had managers who were coked out during the day. There's one guy in particular who would be on adderall and just stare me down for no good reason. It got to be uncomfortable after a while, to the point where I no longer wanted to there anymore.   Also, since Zillow bought Trulia, it stopped being any sort of fun in the Denver office. It used to be a really fun place to work. I used to look forward to going in because every day was a new adventure. Then, somewhere along the line, it just turned into straight up drudgery. Also, there is little to no room for advancement.   It's a good place to cut your teeth but I wouldn't want to be there more than 2 years. that would be my maximum. it's changed for the worse, that's for sure and that's the consensus on the floor. One region, right now, is fomenting mutiny. It's just a matter of time before that situation blows up. The die-hards will stay because they're grandfathered in. I can see a mass exodus within the next 6 months happening.","The horse is out of the barn now. It's not a fun place to work at anymore. hiring managers off the street is not a good idea if you can avoid it. I know you want ""fresh perspectives"" but think about the message it sends to people. think about the message it sends to those directly affected. We had a manager hired off the street. The consensus was ""this is a slap in the face."" a few of those people directly affected by that hire have left Zillow, either of their own volition or fired."

You are a telemarketer that has to cold call 100 real estate agents everyday who do not want to be called. Trust me, they get cold-called everyday and have memorized responses to get off the phone with you. 75% of the time, those agents who do buy are too incompetent to fully utilize the program, and then they blame you for it. The worst part is (and this is where all the stress comes from) you are held responsible for things outside of your control. You have a talk-time quota everyday, meaning your phone has to be connected on calls for 3 1/2 hours a day. Sounds easy? Its incredibly hard and I've even seen senior reps star-6-7 from their own cell phones at the end of the day and let the phone sit there to pad their call time. You can't control if agents pick up the phone, you can't control if they hang up, but that doesn't matter. I've literally made 150 calls a day with low talk time minutes and been told I was not trying. I could see my manager felt for me, but his boss reamed him out because of me, so his hands were tied. I don't have anything bad to say about the company or anything. Its just that the work you will be doing in this specific position sucks. Forever. A senior rep admitted to me that, after 4 years, its just as hard. But I could see she was in her early thirties and didn't have where else to go. There's a lot of those. The trainers see you as a number, not a person. You can see it in their eyes when they look at you. They mentally calculate how long til you wash out and when the new batch comes in and how long til they wash out. They also tell you turn over is 'low' and keep you in a system (you're only among your training class of newbies) that minimizes your ability to hear office rumors. Unfortunately that's where the truth is. And the truth is the turn over is around 80%; the 20% that stick are dog-eat-dog, and you will never be one of the super reps that they will hold up to you as a shining example in training class, who close 140k a month. Those people are 1 in 1000. Oh and btw, you want to move to management? Good luck. Better be willing to show up at 6:45 am and leave at 5:30 pm. For a whole year plus. Hour long lunch breaks are frowned on. I have to work while eating at my desk which is fine I guess, but lets not pretend that's the norm across all businesses. I mean my friend was put on anxiety medication from this job. I'm not making that up. He told me he would wake up at 4 am, stressed out from a dream about selling a zip code. I would have thought that that's crazy, but I had those dreams too.... I'll be gone soon.","Eliminate your talk-time idea. It. Is. Stupid. And it gives incentives to reps to behave shady, to waste time all day with current clients instead of selling new ones. All that matters is sales, not talk time. Its even been admitted ""You don't know what metric equates 1-to-1 to higher sales."" But you think its talk time so you push that. Some reps sell fast and hard and we get our head squeezed for not wasting more time on the phone. Then you burn us out in three months from stress and bring in a new batch. That is called inefficiency."

Engineering talent/leadership is not top level, and if you are the top ranked engineer, you will feel a lot of push back and dragging. And great idea is not easy to spark out. 2. Mid-management is very laid back, need to be more aggressive to help the company moving to the right direction. 3. Granted, long staying people are now in mid-senior management level, but this is the problem of allowing the company to move forward. They have a lot of legacy, which *should* be fixed long ago if committing to it, but unfortunately, the safe route is always selected. 4. A lot of cost optimization can be done within the technical stack, but hard to convince people to care. 5. The technology management/development is traditional, you will see a bunch of Unix admin/DBA and ops, and handing day to day ops and also the blockers of moving fast in SOA world.  I understand a lot of companies have similar problems, probably Zillow is better than all of its peers, but given Zillow is young and want to move to next stage, then it has to do something different.",1.

The goals are a far reach (to say the least) and the payouts have been lowered substantially. We no longer get stock regularly, nor do we get quarterly payouts. For the first year you do get a ramp, which is nice, but once its over the future is grim. It is not sustainable, the stress level can be extremely high. There is not a lot of flexibility or understanding for life's demands outside of work, you are held to your hours without options to work remotely.

The CEO is truly amazing.","Very disappointing - The day-to-day does NOT match the job description. They will try to sell you on the Enterprise team being a ""senior level"" position but they treat you like a very junior, entry level rep. Minus the training and support. I definitely did not trust my manager or director, I know they wouldn't have my back if it came down to it. Very greedy and off-putting. They only like you when you product numbers. The manager is also very junior and can't provide much guidance and actual strategy around roadblocks. If you have more than 4+ years of sales experience, don't expect to gain much development here. You're cold calling all day.  Leadership trying to run a senior sales team like a junior inside sales team. Heavy micromanagement created a hostile environment and overall negative morale amongst the team. I saw some really talented people be let go because of ""attitude"" which really means they challenged their leadership too much on their status quo process.   When looking at the leadership on this particular team, they all came from the premier agent inside sales team at some point so they are naturally trying to run an enterprise team the exact same way which is a true shame. Leadership is not open to suggestions and gets highly defensive. I personally witnessed a meeting where the director asked the room to name a few reasons why the team was severely underperforming and listened to three reps basically get their heads ripped off, replying that each reason was ""an excuse.""  There is very minimal ongoing training. Leadership will come up with new objectives for the reps to perform but give very little guidance - do not mistake this for autonomy because there is definitely none of that here. You are held to daily metrics and expected to work way more than 40+ hours a week - in fact, you are praised for coming in hours early and staying hours late. It is expected.",I don't think there is much point to providing advice as they don't truly welcome it anyways. I'd start by building more trust and communication with the team. I'd also suggest looking at other thriving teams within the company and assess their leadership style vs team performance and maybe try implementing the same principles.

Plus, getting to be part of something really big and really cool; bringing transparency in real estate to everyone, not just the most educated or with the most to gain.   Executive staff really pushes ""zillow culture"" and funds lunches, speakers, and events to keep it going. In Lincoln, the food is usually from local restaurants instead of the national chains. The speakers are typically leaders of well known companies, political figures, or amazing people doing amazing things. A recent speaker was from a non profit building schools in Africa.   It's also cool that in such a huge company the top brass are very accessible, friendly, and really care about the workers doing the entry level jobs. I've emailed the CEO, Spencer, and actually received a friendly response in return. I don't think you'll find that at most companies, especially one the size of Zillow.","Working in a small office outside Seattle, I feel like I'm unable to be promoted or change roles because of the limited jobs and job types in my office.

We get treated extremely well and the perks and benefits are second to none. Thank you X 1 million.   Zillow has a tradition of hiring new employees and immediately asking for their outside feedback, and fresh perspective to create positive change. This is so smart, and really hook, line and sinkered me when I was hired.  Zillow tailors your workflow to your personality, we have 1 on 1s with management whenever we want, they make us their priority and work around us. They give us the freedom to explore avenues within our roles that fit our interests and help develop the skill sets we want to built.   Spencer and the ZG leadership team are pros. They know that different kinds of minds working together in a collaborative space with the right tools can revolutionize an industry. They have created an atmosphere that breeds new ideas and creative solutions. Working on the floor together allows us to collaborate easily, come up with new pilots and make the company better. It makes you feel like you’re doing something important, but we’re having way too much fun. No one has that much fun at work.   They don’t just want to make sure we’re doing well in our jobs they’re helping us develop as humans in life and in our careers. I’m so grateful for the coaching and development I’ve had at ZG. Management is always trying to help us find new ways to learn and grow for what comes next. If you want to teach yourself something new and move into a different department, you just have to want it more than everyone else and work really hard.   Women are actually treated as equals, and this is the first workplace I’ve ever seen with this level of real equality. I think that’s what I love the most about Zillow. I really feel like it’s a melting pot of tons of different people from all walks of life. Working next to someone who’s background and life experiences are different than yours, you really get to know and appreciate them for those differences, not in spite of them. This breaks down barriers and opens dialogues, it makes us better listeners and better people. It’s what we want our country to be like, and it’s honestly a safe haven from the rest of the world for a lot of us. I feel happy, healthy, and safe at my job. I never wake up and dislike coming to work. Everyone is amazing and we’re doing something important.  I’m very personally connected with Zillow’s mission and core values. It’s the reason I joined the company. I want to do something I enjoy, and that I’ll be proud of at the end of the day. I came to work for Zillow because I thought it was the place I could do just that. And it has been 100%, but right now I feel like that is being put in jeopardy which is why I’m writing this review.","I’ve worked at Zillow for over 3 years and enjoyed pretty much every second of it. I try to live our core values every day and I expect the company to operate under those values. Again, that’s why I’m here. Recently certain departments have started outsourcing jobs to 3rd world countries which is taking a toll on our quality and making employees of Zillow Group feel horrible. Don’t tell us how great of a year we had and then outsource portions of our jobs instead of fixing the problems that can be fixed to avoid that. You can’t put 5000 bandages on something and expect it not to fall apart. Take the time to do the job right and figure it out. We can do it.   Also it’s really sad. These people are probably getting paid close to nothing to do some of our jobs, and to me that’s not Acting With Integrity. That’s Donald Trump behavior. We also don’t want to join every other company thats headed down this slippery slope. It makes consumers really angry, and that’s the opposite direction I thought we were going. Everyone’s had the experience where you reach out to customer service and get mad when the message comes back and you can’t understand because it’s a robot or someone who’s half way around the world completely disconnected from the product and the mission. Your problem does not get solved, you don’t get the help you wanted and the experience ultimately leaves a horrible impression. When this happens, people tell everyone. Word of mouth never dies and social media multiplies that. The internet can turn a small and unintentional error into a PR nightmare. Why risk it? We can balance the work, we just need to not get ahead of ourselves, perfect what we’re doing and then move forward. Leadership is being too aggressive, they need to slow down and take the time needed for the engineers to do their jobs and then make their next moves.   This will negatively effect the Zillow Group brand. For many employees across departments this decision is deep within the gray area of the moral/ethical scale we hold ourselves to at ZG.","Focus on making your processes work with the quality that you’re pushing, not against it. Your messaging and actions have to match. Also, stop using positive language tactics to try and bring employees onboard for unpopular initiatives. "

I would say that in the end, the culture they created did not provide an atmosphere that brought out my best, but if sales is your thing and you don't mind pounding out 150 dials a day with lots of noise, then it could be a great fit. They have also transitioned a bit from giving you, the sales rep, control of your book of business to a more hybrid account management model where a waitlist team takes a percent of your sales and you get less commission off upsells and any waitlist calls you make. Part of this makes sense since the premier agent program is now so big that they could not keep the payout as high as it used to be, but it's frustrating to see so many cuts happen on your commission as a sales person.   I would say one of the more frustrating parts about working on the sales floor is the music and ""energy"". Of course energy on a sales floor is important and something that managers are constantly trying to maintain. But at some point in my time there, it simply got out of control to where they handed out plastic clappers to all the sales reps and whenever anyone made a sale, you found yourself caught in a windstorm of clapping plastic hands which, together with the screaming and yelling made for a very loud and obnoxious celebration. Keep in mind you are in close proximity to other reps, and it was not uncommon to be presenting over the phone and get drowned out with the noise. It's easy to get over this in the short-term, but in the long-term, it's the principle of the issue that I found disturbing and one of the core problems that still exists at Zillow to this day. Anyone who complained about the noise level was reprimanded while management seemed scared (or perhaps incapable) of dealing with loud, disruptive reps. This unprofessionalism is simply uncalled for and unnecessary, but for whatever reason it was not only left alone, it was encouraged to the point where mere disruption turned it to outright disrespect from one rep to another if you were asked to quiet down. Some other reps legitimately thought it was fun to be a part of a culture like that, but there are many, many others who simply thought it lacked professionalism and moved on with their careers.   Carefully decide if you function well in that sort of environment if you get a walking tour on your interview and if so, then it could be a great fit for you.","one of the things I heard Spencer say in one of his articles is you should never be afraid to hire someone more qualified then you. Management needs to listen better and help their inside sales reps find ways to thrive personally or else they should rename the role from ""inside sales"" to ""call center rep""."

Not hiring people who are actually experienced in a call center environment is also pretty challenging.","Zillow focuses on the long term goals and not necessarily the short term goals but the PAC department functions on daily numbers and not long term growth in their department and that seems to be a very weak point for the department as people become exhausted and forget core values and the reason we are all there to support our consumers, Zillow has a wonderful sales department to speak with agents but for the first time on a large scale a department has been introduced to speak with the other person behind the key board or app and those voices are not just numbers and connections those are the voice of the consumer's who are trusting Zillow's brand as a tool when finding a home,a second home, an investment or vacation home. I believe long term success for the department is focusing on the consumer and building up technology features that the consumer would be more comfortable with like self set appointments, ability to interacted with agents more freely in the app, installing value and worth in PAC employees that are not just set on number but actually concierge driven by being a caretaker and professional. I have seen so much change in the PAC team and truly have high hopes for the department as it just needs to tidy up a few things and regain focus on the consumer and culture. Zillow was a breath of fresh air since the beginning for me and I am overall happy that I have been part of such a game changing department with a company I will always use as my first choice when looking for real estate."

The position is a great way to meet like minded, career oriented young professionals. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with and appreciated their attitudes. In the CES role you get to start at the ground level in a market changing company and interact with many different audiences from website consumers, to real estate agents, to lenders as well as internal departments. The CES position is what you make it. It can be extremely valuable if you take the time to cultivate relationships, build your network and learn more about Zillow Group. My former manager Justin, was one of the best mangers I have had in my professional career. He took the time to listen to me (regarding the good and the bad), he always made time for me and my team and he was always on our side and represented us in a good light. I have since moved on from that role (and stayed within Zillow Group) but if it was not for Justin, I probably would not have my new position within the company.","Being a CES on the Premier Agent Concierge (PAC) team does come with challenges like any position at any company. PAC was a pilot when I started and grew into a full fledged department within Zillow Group. Now staffing almost 300 employees (including team leads and managers), it comes with growing pains. The job can be monotonous and team leads and managers have a difficult time combating that. You occasionally deal with rude consumers and unprofessional agents. PAC also has long hours and works weekends and holidays so it can be hard to get the time off you want and the schedule does not work for everyone. Zillow Group has a phenomenal culture with company events and perks and PAC member do not always get the opportunity to part-take in those. Management says they are working on it but have never had a successful solution. Much of this has to do with the nature of the job and isn't necessarily a short coming on Zillow's behalf, but they are things applicants should be aware of.","Overall, it was an honor to work in PAC and see all the exciting growth and the big changes. Management needs to continue to listen to PAC member when they have concerns or ideas as these can radically help the growth of not only PAC but Zillow as a company. One last shout out to my previous manager Justin, thank you for everything that you did and continue to be the best team lead that PAC has ever seen!"

You don't have to be a good engineer.,"This is a pretty lame company for an engineer. tl;dr - you will not get to make any decisions, you will not even be given any information until it's time for you to grind out some code, there is no sense of career growth whatsoever, and your coworkers will be lazy.  Orders and all company decisions are handed down from the top. If their decisions are wrong, they'll fire some middle manager scapegoat and craft new ones without listening to their employees.  Product managers will hangout in meetings and won't invite engineers even when they're discussing important details and information about the products said engineers will be working on. You will be told what to do, you don't contribute to the vision.  Zillow has a lot of B-rate ""senior"" engineers who will stop any change, regardless if it's beneficial, to the code/stack. A lot of them are pretty lousy workers too. If you're not brought on as a senior hire, you will get the monotonous work. This is not the place for any sort of career (or personal) growth as an engineer.   HR is trying to engineer the company culture, which means you have to do stupid things to entertain their whims and a lot of awkward, low-budget events happen around the office. Many people just take the opportunities to go home early, so much for the company culture.  The finance department is very bureaucratic, it will take a long time to get anything, to say the least.","Top managers are excellent business strategists, but this means Zillow is a top-down, command company, where employees don't get to contribute ideas or grow very much professionally. They need to flip their company care on its head and let the employees (not HR) run the company and envision the products, while they make the business maneuvers. Nothings more annoying than having a manager tell you you're happy. Zillow feels like a place where upper management is trying really hard to engineer the company happiness, instead of just letting employees be happy from contributing and taking on responibility on their own."

The way they fire employees is absurd as well, they will pack your desk while you are in the restroom or on break, and meet you in the hall (keep in mind this is an open floor that all of the employees and management share) with your box of things and walk you out. In front of everyone. When they try to offer some reasoning for the employees dismissal, they are very hush hush and do not posses transparency. They do not “turn on the lights”. The core and heart of the company has major faults, unfortunately nothing is being done about those faults. They are simply covering them with bandaids and even offering a candy wall for your troubles. My advice; don’t give into the gimmicks, save yourself the stress of job security and the stress of pettiness; do not work for Zillow.","While I heard many times that management cares, I never experienced a time where that reigned true. But If there is a chance that you will consider this advice; take a look inside. Companies tend to blame employees and others for issues they deal with, sure there’s issues with growing big businesses, but at the end of the day, businesses last because of moral and “good business”. Employee retention is so important, but maybe I’m old fashioned. I believe Zillow needs a revamp."

From the interview process which was the longest, rudest most unprofessional experience where I had to jump through hoops like a circus animal, to the week of training in Seattle where I was immediately made to feel unwelcome and had my motives for being there questioned. If you are a seasoned professional sales rep this is not the company for you.   The company is predominantly young millennials who very much think they are the smartest people in the room. With little life experience and job experience they also believe the executives are, and I'm quoting here from what I was told ""The smartest people in the whole world"". Though I don't doubt there are some very bright minds working at the company, they are by no means ""The Smartest People In The Whole World"". Statements like that quickly show how immature, easily influenced and inexperienced their young managers are.","Young Sales trainer who has never worked as a sales trainer or been in sales and therefor has never sold anything in her life is going to ""train you"". She is unprofessional and will question why you're there on your first day and make you feel unwelcome. She will then talk about you behind your back and bad mouth you to your manager and others in the company.   Unprofessional, rude, condescending attitude, almost everyone in a leadership role thinks they know everything and they are better than you.  Young managers with no management experience, leadership experience, tact or people skills.   Outside Sales Managers have no power to build their own teams. The power lies with people you interview with at Zillow's corporate headquarters where they have some type of utopia hiring decision and the ""panel"" must all agree on hiring a candidate. Even though some of the people you interview with are not even in the same division you'd be working in or people you'd be working with directly. Never have I seen a sales organization that doesn't give managers and/or Directors the power to build their own teams but their teams are chosen for them by people at corporate. Basically they are managers in title only. If you're a sales manager, don't apply here!   They don't want individuals. Drink the kool aid and fall in line.  They have a telemarketer mentality that doesn't translate to outside sales reps. They need to learn there is a difference.  Please, please, please if this helps in any way to spare anyone else from dealing with the most unprofessional people and being jerked around so badly by a company that claims they're all about Power to the People, just not their own people and Turning on the Lights except when it comes to fair and ethical treatment of their employees. I truly hope you will think twice before wasting your time with this company. The ""kool-aid"" drinking millennials who think because snacks, beverages, and yogurt are provided for them are the ones that think it's the best job ever.  Trust your intuition and run fast and far from this company!","The world is not a Utopia! Diversity makes the world go round. You have some real flaws in your hiring process as well as the people you have hired. It's not OK to treat people the way your employees have treated me. Those employees are a representation of your company, it's important that you know those people ARE NOT REPRESENTING your company well when they are being rude and unprofessional."

Veteran employees are willing to offer advice.","The whole premise of the company is based on misinformation. The Zestimate is one thing but it's difficult to get behind selling a product when the listing information is outdated, doesn't represent reality, and only causes headaches for real estate agents... that they're very willing to let you know about call after call. The company touts their traffic numbers but I'd be curious how much of that is inflated by people trying to solve a problem the site has created for them.  Being a new rep is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons but one the company will have to confront is an utter lack of availability that doesn't meet demand. 80% of ""successful"" calls where the agent wants to buy end in you only being able to offer a ZIP two hours away from them that nobody wants. A saturation point is nearing and for new reps without a book of business, their best hope is to get clients on a waiting list and get lucky. The veteran reps with a book of business are much more likely to succeed because their clients get waitlist priority. Even if Zillow changes this and opens the program to more people, it will lose its exclusivity and alienate existing Premier Agents.  While the metrics are demanding and about twice as much as expected on a daily basis as in other companies, the issue isn't so much with the expectations; rather, it's the paradoxical ramifications of meeting those expectations. Since the company requires 210 minutes of talk time each day, you must constantly be dialing. The problem with this is if your goal is to meet talk time, it's very difficult to do so if you're trying advanced prospecting and looking to find people who haven't been called. You're left using run-of-the-mill prospecting tools where everybody has been called. While upper management would dismiss this, it's pretty simple: you choose talk time or sales.  You better be a great telemarketer because that's exactly what this job is. You're calling the most solicited profession and they not only likely hate Zillow, they get 10 sales calls a day from similar companies. There is nothing consultative about closing deals at Zillow- you better be able to have a ""shotgun"" approach and be as ""salesy"" as it comes.","Be more willing to confront your weaknesses and less eager to paint lipstick on a pig. If the retention rate of reps is so low and the company has a reputation as such, do something about it."

There's no dress code,decent base pay. Games and bonuses.","If your seriously considering working for this company you should read this. The job sounds really great at first, your told you have an opportunity to make 6 figures a year and you get a competitive base, which isn't bad. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't hit quota which by the way is ridiculously hard to hit every month since most of the product your selling is sold out, they will literally fire you after 2 months of not hitting......Your quota increases each month which is called your ramping period. you literally can never take a vacation, get sick, etc.... Doesn't matter if you get 3 weeks of vacation time., the job gets easier is a load of you know what, if you increase sales goals how can it get easier. On top of that you have to have a minimum talk time for 210 minutes, the problem with that is you will spend most of the day leaving voicemails which are about 1 minute each, you literally have to push through a call to talk to someone which gets difficult because most real estate agents don't want to talk to you, they get the same call all day by everyone else, also forget about breaks and lunches or you will be there all night trying to hit call time, call time can only be accomplished by working through breaks and lunches and a little extra after work hours, the reps that hit it talk to there old clients they have known for a while, the problems is if your new you don't have that luxury.The reps who do well are the ones who been there for a year that have a large book of clients ( by the way there are literally 15 reps who been there that long), they just call there old clients and up sell them, this is easier for them because product was plentiful, and easier to sale when they started,, and most of these reps are burned I've seen reps making good money quit, that should tell you something. The worst thing is the turn over, they literally have a sales class every month to replace reps , I guess this shouldn't matter, but its show's instability, and that's a turn off especially if your looking at this as a long term career.. I think most people quit because they simply run out of gas, there is no balance with personal and work life, this is the most intense sales job, and I have a extensive sales background, most reps have anxiety working here, it will do that to you, and you will have to deal with it everyday . The main thing that shocked me is how unprofessional it is, managers use a ton of profanity, and have questionable activities that ill keep to myself, which made me lose respect for a select few, you should look at a person in authority for comfort and reassurance and guidance, there a bunch of cheer leaders who will only talk to you and give you a high five or recognition if you make a sale, other than that, they are not that approachable no managerial skills at all, that may be do to the fact there all recent college students with no leadership background . I'm writing this because I have seen many good people lose there jobs or get stressed and quit. I feel if I can help someone before they consider working here it was all worth it. I encourage you to ask lots of question before you join this company. There are great sales jobs with less stress and a better quality of life.","My advice to management is to change your strategy towards low performing reps. People like myself are reassigning, or getting terminated in other cases. It's simply not a great recipe for success, churn and burning good people because they didn't hit a goal sucks especially when they are not told that in the interview, that seems really important to me. If I'm coaching a team and my best player had 2 off games I'm not going to kick him off the team, because I know his potential. You should give a 6 month policy towards underperforming reps. Also, lower call time a bit, reps are getting burned out they can't take lunch because there afraid of not hitting call time, sure older reps have no problem but they account for 10 - 15% of the sales floor. Also when you take vacations sales goals should be lowered or eliminated, how can you enjoy much needed time with your family if your stressing about quota? And lastly have more training for reps that are under performing, I think it's better to keep somone who shows promise than to dismiss them, training isn't taking a rep in to a office and using scare tactics to get them too perform better."

They do buy lunch for the reps the last of the month which is nice, but not worth how you're treated in other ways.","Don't believe the reviews on glass door that are positive. People are literally given a severance when they are fired JUST to put good reviews up here. If you miss quota (even by $100) twice in a row you will be put on plan and expected to hit a ridiculous number in two weeks and if you don't they walk you right out the door. They expect you to be able to hit 210 minutes of talk time per day MINIMUM that's 3.5 hours people. This is next to impossible when you are making over 100 calls a day and getting hung up on 95% of the time. If you speak to veterans they maybe use 5% of their day to cold call new clients, BUT if you're new you have to COLD CALL ONLY 100% of your day and 100% of your quota. DO NOT WORK HERE. I was there for 9 months and would hit my talk time everyday and quota every month. I missed quota by $2k one month and was put on plan even though my rolling average was over 156% of quota since I started. When you are new you are meant to make them quick money and then they throw you flat on your face. You will hardly be able to take a lunch and your first year you will be expected to work 10-12 hour days. It's a company that doesn't care about their employees at all as individuals. Pretty sad because the environment tricks you to think otherwise. I had 12 people in my training group. After 3 months half of the people either quit or walked out. After 8 months there were only 2 of us left. And after 9 all of us had quit or been walked out.","Maybe start managing? When we had a sale stolen from us our manager wouldn't fight for our sale and would mostly answer with, ""Well what happens, happens, nothing I can do"" this would happen on sales that I had called 2 days ago and pitched and a different rep would close them. It was a blatant steal. They say there are Salesforce 'rules' but they really don't matter."

I have inherited quite a few accounts from previous employees (this seems to happen often it is fast moving revolving door here) the accounts i have taken over tell me they gets theses calls every other month or sometimes monthly and they have taken it a few times but have yet to see and increase in ROI they say the ROI gets worse as we do this? and no this has not happened once , i hear this from a lot of those accounts it is discouraging.
