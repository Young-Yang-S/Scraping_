A great entry into the service and SaaS world and an impressive resume builder.   They do a great job recruiting and hiring intelligent and fun individuals and if you want an in-office job they will be returning in some form post covid.   As an SDR and AE you have the name recognition and a fairly steady flow of inbound leads & you’re able to work and close expansions.","Of course there were fun times like happy hours and team events, but overall the sales organization at Zendesk was honestly exhausting and toxic. Someone shared this with me and it 100% sums up my experience at Zendesk, “I thought I was at a company with a great culture until I left and realized I was just at a place where I worked with my friends”   When I started, people genuinely loved their jobs and had a work life balance - that was not the case for me or many of my colleagues. To highlight a few reasons: - Culture fell to the wayside, and while there were some added benefits for your wellbeing during covid, it was a band aid approach. - While there are 20 PTO and 10 sick days, most sales reps could not take all or even a majority of them because of high quotas.  - If there was a “fair” quota, it did not exist for long and sales reps were treated as machines to pump out their number.  - Salaries are below market standards with little to no room to negotiate during internal promotions.  - This past year there were widespread examples of new reps with less experience (external and internal) with higher salaries than tenured reps. When it was brought up to management, reps were shamed for sharing salaries.  - If you are hired into a new role or there is a major change to the department, forget your work life balance - hello overtime, stress & burnout!   The level of micromanagement and lack of trust was outstanding. Management’s focus was rarely on what worked well for the individual rep and only on how to keep everyone “in check”. Certain managers discouraged or even prohibited reps from leaving their desk to work in soft spaces around the office, from booking rooms to have meetings/make calls in, or pre-covid from having the flexibility to work from home.   There were a few managers that were truly great but they were the exception and oftentimes had to stick their neck out on behalf of their team.   Another extremely frustrating part of Zendesk was the career progression.  - The ability to transition to other departments was advertised and encouraged during the interview process, but that was not the case.  - There was a lack of consistency with internal promotions and of the requirements to be considered.  - Promotion requirements went from a holistic approach on brand, contribution, activity, and attainment, to an added tenure requirement, and ended where the main focus was on quota attainment.  - Even during a pandemic, internal reps who came close on attainment were not considered, despite consistently high activities and who were qualified on all other fronts.  I was honestly lucky with my experience of promotions, but I witnessed many talented and exceptional peers screwed over, and ultimately it all came down to internal politics and favoritism.   If you can put your head down and be a compliant worker who shows up, does not speak in opposition, and can ignore everything except what absolutely infuriates you, then you will do fine in the sales org at Zendesk.   If you want to feel like you're making an impact and thrive in a collaborative, feedback welcomed culture, you'll probably be disappointed.   I’m grateful for my experience and the friends I’ve made, but unfortunately for Zendesk, no one I’ve spoken with has regretted leaving, their only regret was thinking something would change and waiting it out as long as they did.","Listen to your employees and actually action their feedback. Go fix your sales org - lesson the workload for AEs so they can actually sell and give back a work life balance with competitive salaries (not just competitive when you hit accelerators). Give career progression opportunities - help individuals who want to change departments and promote those loyal, hardworking employees before they have no choice but to leave."

Individuals who ask questions, challenge the status quo, and do not believe in doing things the way they’ve always been done simply because that’s the way they’ve always been done are thought of as trouble makers, difficult and “not a culture fit”.

Some roles only have one or two onsite candidates, and it’s a “hired”.","Many individuals all have left reviews about no transparency when it comes to promotion or raise. Introducing some structured performance reviews can help avoid favoritism and ensure fairness during the process. It is great that Zendesk cares about employees well-being but most of the time, what matters the most to the employee is career advancement. Please also give manager enough training. Some managers doesn’t care about employees’ career growth and can be aggressive or even put you down when you bring up promotion or ask for raise. Maybe this is uncommon, but it does happen. Managers should be open and genuinely care about employees’ growth. Also, improve the recruiting process. No roles should have only one or two candidates and then be filled. The consequences of a bad hire are catastrophic."

After talking to co-workers, I realized that my experience was not unique.   As I've reluctantly continued my career in sales at Zendesk, they have pushed back against negotiating salary, continuously increased quotas to nearly unobtainable and certainly unrealistic levels, and stripped away opportunities for bonus incentives. As more and more leadership comes on from larger organizations (Oracle, Salesforce, Amazon), the culture at Zendesk is being squandered at an attempt to drive revenue at an unrealistic pace. You can see the sales team and their managers experiencing a crisis, the blood beginning to boil as leadership strips pay away, and tenured reps leaving for the competition. The actions taken by this organization as of late do not bode well for employee retention.","Go back to your roots, reevaluate whether revenue is more important than workplace experience and the happiness of your employees.

Everyone was willing to help one another and looking to grow and be better. They had an incredibly flexible PTO policy which made work-life balance better than any other company I've worked for. I find my friends saying ""you'll never find another place like Zendesk"" and I believe that to be true. I felt it was a relatively easy life there. I felt challenged but at the same time it was an easy product to understand and to sell.","Their goal as an organization is to move into the Enterprise. Unfortunately their focus is still incredibly transactional which is how Zendesk grew so quickly. This transactional foundation is a huge detriment to the goal of moving into the Enterprise because much of the leadership team is influenced by the people who've grown up within the organization and therefore drive the process from the ground up. Almost all reps still speak regularly at the practitioner level and the conversations are not value driven. I believe Zendesk has been so successful thus far because the product is great and easy to use.   My goal in being there was to progress my sales career to work more complex and Enterprise/Strategic deals. While they certainly have some great Enterprise Logos, the footprint of those organizations is still relatively small. Zendesk does not focus on the outcomes that companies are trying to achieve in choosing their solution and because of this, sales reps are consistently delegated down to low level contacts. I left Zendesk because the culture had changed significantly. The leadership team has gotten incredibly political and there is clear favoritism throughout the organization. In addition, there are a few people who because of their political ties, basically run the organization and if you have a misstep with them, it can cost you your job and reputation which is unfortunate. This means you have to be very careful about who you trust there and the information you share.","Your sales leadership team is driven by emotion and cliques. This means that anyone who challenges their path is pushed out. This shows a resistance to change. It also means that anyone who's not willing to play the political card with the right people are not recognized and are invisible and therefore feel under valued. So even if you hit quota but are silent, you're less likely to get promoted, get approvals or get recognition."

The Zendesk company I joined a year ago is very different than the current iteration of Zendesk. I was heavily recruited for a position that has of late been de-valued for no real reason or probably more likely they would like to see done by a younger cheaper resource. Favoritisms is a real thing here and some managers have been known to favor their younger employees. On the other hand, the older seniors managers are generally former executives from org’s like Oracle, SAP, SFDC, some AWS etc that are bringing their companies ideas to Zendesk as they struggle to serve the Enterprise market. That is not Zendesk’s roots and the company is going through a painful identity crisis as a result. I heard an expression from a former executive that was readying a massive reorganization that said “everyone wants to go to Heaven but no one wants to die”. Yeah, right now it’s kinda like that. Some big changes are coming and it’s going to be interesting to see how the company emerges. Your mileage will definitely vary here at this time.",Commit to your vision whatever it may be. Going the Enterprise route can and will alienate some of your current customers so I hope your plan can be successful but it might be a bumpy road initially. Show some empathy for those impacted because right now you have managers that are behaving immaturely. You could loose some very talented people in the process. If you want attrition handle it so there are no ill feelings.

I understand there is a $120 parking benefit for Zendesk and I appreciate that. However, the Tenderloin is probably not the best place for a growing company. This is something employees cannot control and I know it is a huge negative about Zendesk. There is no way to sugar coat this.   Many employees that were here in the early stages of Zendesk are gone or pushed out. (Talking about employees that started before 2016). In order to survive at Zendesk, favoritism was something you better hope your management has for you. There was a recent hire where a Sr director decided to just build a team with people who use to work for her. This ultimately created a separation from the longer tenured employees and a huge level of favoritism.  The level of favoritism at Zendesk made it hard for my team to stay motivated and work harder. In my opinion, this has to be addressed. I understand there are people you prefer to work with, but it got to a point where if you didn't agree with the direction the team is heading towards. You will be placed in their cross hairs. I also understand change is something that is hard to adapt to. However, if employees in your team are unhappy and leaving one by one. I don't have much to say. That in itself is a red flag.","I appreciate all the things management has done such as 401k match. 401k match was something that was not around until late 2017.

In that vein there is a strong respect for family and work life balance relative to other tech companies in the bay area. While it varies by group working hours in the office typically start at between 9-10am. And most people leave between 5-6pm so there are very few folks around past 6:00pm. Compensation is generally lower than at other tech firms. But it is probably fair given the number of hours worked.","CHALLENGES MOVING UP MARKET The company is going through a challenging transition as it moves from its early success being a help desk software platform for startups and smaller businesses to one that is now focused on moving up market and selling customer service software to larger more established businesses. Zendesk has promised Wall Street that it will achieve $1B in revenue by 2020. This is an aggressive goal that has put a lot of short term stress on the business (and correspondingly its employees) each quarter as it figures out how to live up to the promise.  To achieve $1B in my mind means fully committing to moving up market and selling to enterprise buyers. This has been hard for the company as it is requires the company to be the type of business that the original Zendesk was trying to disrupt. As Mikkel the CEO writes in his book Startupland ""we shared a healthy disdain for the traditional enterprise software sales model. The big platforms, the expensive salespeople with the expense accounts, the semireligious conferences, the PowerPoint software, the locked-in relationships"".  This move up market requires that requires the company to change a lot of what made it successful early on. The company needs to build new muscles in sales and marketing to support enterprise which requires new skills, new processes, and often times new people. This has resulted in multiple reorganizations (or ""evolutions"" as they are now calling them) in sales and marketing that have been fairly disruptive and caused a lot of angst for people in terms of having clear roles and responsibilities.  LACK OF URGENCY The work life balance mentioned as a pro also means that the company does not move as quickly as other places. And as a result there is not a lot of ""urgency"" within the company to get stuff done quickly. This can be frustrating for those who do have urgency and are trying to push others to have the same mindset.  NOT A DATA/ANALYTICS CULTURE The company has historically not been one that relied significantly on data/metrics to make decisions. It's always done things by the seat of its pants and is not particularly buttoned up. As a result there is not a strong data/analytics culture within the company and the corresponding data/analytics infrastructure including reporting and systems reflects that. So often the data required to make decisions is not available, incomplete, or simply inaccurate. The company is trying to change this but it requires a lot of work to undo years of neglect. So for folks that want to have reliable data to make decisions Zendesk may not be the best fit.  DIVERSITY & CAREER ADVANCEMENT While the company has initiatives around diversity the company is still not very diverse at the senior and mid level management positions and there seems to be a bias for younger employees. This seems to be ingrained into the companies recruiting culture. In fact two of its most senior and long tenured minority Vice Presidents just announced their departure October 2017. The company does have a history of promoting young employees who are willing to work hard and go the extra mile. There are at least 3 VPs that have been promoted in the last year that are under 30. Many of the older senior leaders are being pushed out.","Wall Street certainly rewards growth and setting an aggressive goal of $1B in revenue is to be commended. However, it also necessitates focusing on short term revenue goals which when you are trying to shift the business is challenging. I'd encourage management to think more about the long term strategy and providing enough air cover and protection to allow employees to invest in initiatives that will fuel the future growth of Zendesk."

Onboarding is a snap - I've had everything necessary to do my job since my first day in the office. This includes hardware (workstation and peripherals), software (operational applications, task-specific applications), security (right-sized access to data/tools) and mentoring (vast team knowledge and a role-related ""buddy"" to answer any questions). New hires need to get up to speed quickly, and this enables it.  Freedom to work where you are comfortable. Prefer a booth or a couch over sitting at your desk? No problem - there are plenty of different types of spots to settle in to get work done. Use of technology to meet also bridges communication gaps that are typically present in companies with teams that are literally based around the world.  Reduced overhead. Need a mouse? Get one.

Non-technical PMs trying to run engineering teams makes things double worse.  - The operations engineering organization is an absolute nightmare. Things take forever to get done and any efforts to fix this has not been effective.  - The company lacks long term strategic thinking and tends to follow industry leaders without being thought leaders.  - There has been a lot of attrition in the company in the past six months.

They're fantastic people who you celebrate the best times with, and drink away the worst of times with.  -The office is a fantastic space with gorgeous views. The in-office perks are pretty fantastic  -As long as you're doing your job, you can pretty much coast by and do a so-so job and still get somewhere in the company (get a raise/promoted/bonus).  -It's a relatively young office; so co-workers are always open to getting drinks after work.","Where do I start: -There is not a standard set of expectations for employees company-wide. Employees who work in larger departments need to work harder to shine; while those in smaller departments who are absolutely terrible at their job can either get promoted/raises/bonuses pretty easily.  -Employees can do a terribly at their job, and still get promoted due to a lack of applicants/talent for jobs. The same can be said for people in their position a prolonged period of time. I'm not saying this is the case for all employees, but it really degrades the title of your position. My advice to anyone going into support is to do your time, get to know the hiring managers in other departments, tailor your time in support to where you want to end up, and get out of support as soon as you can.  -There is no pay scale implemented at all. Team leads can sometimes make less than those on their teams; there no standardization when it comes to pay. There can be an alarming gap between employees who hold the same title. Some employees with a job title that is in a tier below another can make the same, if not more than an employee in a higher tier of the same department. You're better off not telling anyone what you make, or asking what others make (because good luck getting that pay bump).   -There's definitely a considerable amount of politicking that goes on in the background, and it doesn't help the employees at all. The company could use a little more transparency rather than sugar-coating unpleasant news.   -It's a relatively young office; so some questionable decisions are bound to be made.","Keep doing what you're doing if you want to become the next Epic. You're not working people to death by any means; but the mental stress that goes into putting up with your ""initiatives"" is something else. You're hiring the right people, but the way company is treating them is another issue. For a company whose product is customer service, the employees who support the product are definitely at the bottom of the totem pole in the company."

CEO cares so deeply about customers, community and employees as opposed to his own ego or riches. Laughter and joy are the most common emotions expressed.   Customers LOVE LOVE LOVE Zendesk, even if our product (and people) aren't perfect. When a customer tells us they are leaving for a competitor, we actually help them do it, and treat them with respect and care on their way out. And they often come back when they realize they'be been duped.   Nobody in the company is satisfied with any aspect of the product, company, design or culture. This gives us all a sense of ""kaizen"" (continuous improvement) which is very healthy. Plus the Zen thing is more than a fat Buddha on the website, it's weirdly (and appropriately) weaved throughout our culture.

Managers would not get in involved in activities either (unless it was a team bonding activity and paid for by the company). > People can work from home, which is a nice perk but often a whole department will be WFH leaving the office very dead and low energy, and then people are complaining why they have to do virtual meetings or rearrange things because half the team is OOO. > The business is growing very quickly and because of that many processes are being put in place have really hindered the speed of delivery - lots of bureaucracy.  > Even though it's originally an European business, all major decisions and ELT/ leadership sit in SanFran. It's the American way and everyone else has to follow or adapt. > Major diversity issues in some departments > Lots of Salesforce and Oracle people; same bunch of people, same bunch of ideas and thought processes. Zendesk is becoming a mini-version of these companies. > Unless you're in a small team, career progression is hard and a 'promotion' in job title is not enough - you still have the same responsibilities  Overall, if you're looking to join a company with a strong culture and want to make an impact I would not recommend you choose Zendesk. They're only getting bigger and you'll be a small cog in the machine. You're better off going to a start-up/ mid-size firm. The culture is becoming more and more corporate.

Also, most people in higher management roles (Directors and above) are middle age white men. Surprised?  On another note - CAREER PROGRESSION does NOT exist.

Don't ignore them when you see them in the corridor ! Take an interest in what they do.

Changing priorities all the time so its extremely difficult to understand what is important to focus on.  - The senior leadership team in EMEA has a lack of vision. Its lead by expectation rather than leading by inspiration.  - Too much of a booze culture and who you know not what you know environment.  - Make promotions based on perception which doesn't always reflect results.  - The environment has gotten worse over time.,- Enlist employees more in the vision of the company. The people on the ground are dealing with customers everyday and will give great insight into making better decisions. Lean on the talent within the company.

There are many opportunities and it is relatively open to exploring my interests even if they fall outside of my specific role. For example, I am passionate about learning foreign languages and as a company that has clientele around the globe, there are many conversations in non-English languages. I've been successful at getting myself into many of those conversations even though I was not directly hired for it. Zendesk also has an inclusive and welcoming environment. I have worked at the office in Madison and in Singapore and both have felt this way. The company organizes many events and is inclusive of all employees to participate. There is also an awesome feeling of empowerment both on the job and in the larger community. CSR is an important part of our job and even though I don't participate as much as others, it feels great to see our CEO so active. Lastly, it is open in terms of rank and file employees approaching management or senior management to express concerns or to socialize.","As a new company, many policies and procedures are not clearly defined, frequently change, or are simply not good. I think that as it is raplidly growing there is also constant change, which can be good for the opportunity it provides, but also bad as the structure can often be insufficient. There is also a lot of change as Zendesk continues transitioning away from start-up mentality (1600+ employees) to more corporate: more bureaucracy, more inflexible policies, more segmentation and siloing of responsibilities. Though these can be good things in ways, they can also be very negative for one seeking the openness and flexibility of startup.","Work on providing more clearly defined structure to employees so they can be more certain about their position, their responsibilities, limitations and extent of duties, and company policies so that they can focus on doing awesome things. Also, don't lose the charm of the lean Danish start-up that has made Zendesk so attractive."

Cool office and central location for the London office. Nice clients to work with.,"It's a startup and as with all startups, it either works or is doesnt. Zendesk management is not capable of planning ahead and calculating budgets which leaves us with mega targets. Lately a lot of people have been hired only to be fired again when the company finds out there is no budget (bad planning). There is no proper HR as they are not certified and experienced enough to function as an actual HR department so you might as well discuss HR issues with the cleaner. There are no contracts either so you basically don't have a leg to stand on. Recruitment is currently eating out of their nose and seem to hire everyone that is interested but not qualified. The recruiters that did add value and were easy to talk to or ask questions to have been kicked out due to budgetting. Have seen some very lovely people go and will probably leave pretty soon myself. It kind of feels like being on the titanic which can sink any day now.","Hire qualified people who have done the work for a few years before, not just those that come from the competitior as that doesn't always mean they are right for the job.
