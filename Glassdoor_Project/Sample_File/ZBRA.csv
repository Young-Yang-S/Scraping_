Zebra Technologies,ZBRA, IL,Lincolnshire,"March 6, 2021",,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,Former,,,,, Procurement Manager,"Recommends, Positive Outlook, Approves of CEO",full time,,,,,More than 5 years,,,"Aside from the stupendous people, company culture, and compensation package,  1. I really appreciated Zebra's approach to promoting the personal learning and development of its team members, and the resources and platform provided as part of the approach (including openness to in-person attendance of events and travel costs - if any). 2. Zebra had great focus on Inclusion and Diversity which was very refreshing. 3. I was also impressed with Zebra's willingness to invest in systems and tools (implementation, maintenance, enhancement/innovation and support) that make the jobs of the employees easier, more productive and more efficient (vs limping along with manual processes and/or rudimentary MS Office-based applications). 4. Promoting innovation was also a strong cultural value.","1. While Zebra clearly promoted learning & development and provided opportunities for growth and new experiences at the same general job level, there was no clear career path outlining how to advance, and - for those who target growth into leadership as part of their career journey - there was limited opportunity for advancement.  2. Related to this, when hiring for leadership positions, there seemed to be a strong bias to candidates with work experience in consulting services (i.e., ex-consultants) - most of whom were external candidates. This was very limiting and frustrating to internal candidates who had built strong experience within the company and in whom so much had been invested by Zebra in their professional development (which seemed to be all mis-utilized by the general tendency to continuously hire leaders from the outside).  3. Also, advancement opportunity seemed uneven across different business functions (e.g., new leaders (Directors and above) were being named in IT, HR and Marketing almost every other year - some even jumping from manager to Senior Director within a couple of years vs other areas where senior individual contributors or managers stagnate for many years). 4. Lastly, while also trying to promote innovation, there was an aversion to attempts at relatively significant system- or process changes (even those that had a relatively good business case). The preference was in the general safety of smaller, incremental innovations or improvements.","Ex-consultants bring great experience, but so do your internal team members in whom you've invested so much. Also, where there may be a reasonable case for such, don't be afraid of making bigger innovations or changes; many times higher risk yields higher return."

If you’re from the industries that Zebra caters to (eg, warehouses, supply chain, manufacturing, t&l, retail), Zebra is one of the top solution sellers and is well-known. If your not, you might struggle to learn because nobody ever explains what all the acronyms mean. The learning curve is steep. If you’re from one of those industries and you enjoy them, I’m sure Zebra will provide you with work and opportunities that you will enjoy. Zebra is a global company and has a lot of globally remote employees around the world. If you work in a location with a big office (Lincolnshire HQ or Holtsville, NY), you will have your traditional cafeteria and gym as perks.","Zebra boasts its employee retention, but that just means you’ll have a lot of lifers, who are people who have been with the company basically their whole careers. Zebra has acquired several companies in their 50 years, thus leading to this phenomena. There is little growth path for your career, but if you are ok with doing the job you have with occasional title bumps, then this can be the place for you. There is a lot of senior leadership due to this fact, and literally everyone wants to have their say in product direction. This bloat makes decisions take forever, we have a ton of ineffective remote meetings with 10+ people, and it takes awhile for anything to really actually get done. Par for the course for B2B, though. Lastly, if you’re a woman, depending on the field you’re in, you should be warned. Zebra is a company with few women, many of them in HR, Legal, or Marketing. Other departments, especially engineering, are heavily male and it shows. It’s a giant boys’ club and some inappropriate comments have been made about women on several occasions. It doesn’t help that the Lincolnshire and Holtsville offices aren’t basically in the middle of nowhere suburbs of Chicago and Long Island really attracting a lot of older Gen X or Boomers over younger talent. Feeds into the boys’ club culture. If you’re a woman in a technical role considering a position at Zebra, be warned. Many men will not take a thing you say into consideration even if it is warranted and backed by data simply because you are a woman. I’m sure the culture will change, but it’s going to take those lifers to retire to have that culture change.",Think about how to retain your women and how to attract young talent. Nobody young wants to live in the far north suburbs or Chicago or in the middle of Long Island. Your initiatives like the Women’s Inclusion Network are useless because the women who attend are in departments that are dominated by women. Think about the women in other roles that are being unheard or undervalued simply because they’re in a sea of men.

But in actuality, preferential treatment towards legacy Motorola employees is building walls of resentment. Employees are becoming demoralized by the obvious unfair treatment and lack of foresight from upper management.  Legacy Zebra - no merit increases, no bonus eligibility until 2016 (and then only at 50% for the first year), Legacy Motorola - merit increases AND 100% retention of bonus eligibility.The spirit-crushing way that Zebra legacy employees were 'rewarded' for their 2015 performance was one of the most deplorable actions I've ever witnessed. Only after serious backlash did management conclude that a 2% payout for legacy Zebra employees would be offered. - Legacy Motorola ideas and structures are given higher value than those of Legacy Zebra. - Way too much red tape and policies. Zebra gets in its own way and has trouble executing and getting anything done. - Procrastination and over-analysis make actual decisions hard to come by. - Risk of failure completely paralyzes teams responsible for moving a project forward. - Inconsistent strategies and product definition. Too many changes and feature additions in the middle of a design cycle that have to be managed without adding cost or affecting the calendar.","Remember it was the legacy Zebra employees dedication, support and effort that allowed Zebra to succeed and be able to acquire Motorola.

The technology areas in which Zebra now plays are growing exponentially, and our senior staff recognizes that we need to take more calculated risks in response to our customer’s rapidly changing needs.  The Zebra culture is not for everyone. As is mentioned elsewhere by other Glassdoor reviewers, Zebra maintains a “small company feel” – and I wholeheartedly agree with that. However, my take on “small company feel” is that self-starters who take personal pride and responsibility for their individual contributions and are comfortable (and even enjoy) the ambiguity of challenging work – they will thrive in this culture.

While not vibrant and energized like many tech companies, every one at Zebra overall is kind, supportive and helpful. It is a family friendly culture with good work life balance. Zebra is becoming more open to suggestions and often, although sometimes overkill with too many meetings, they do take the time to ask for feedback and evaluate what can be improved upon. Might be slow to make improvements, but at least employees recommendations are acknowledged and thoughtfully, taken into consideration. For sales, quota is not extreme and overall fair when compared to other sales companies. Although a bit tight-lipped on budget for sales initiatives, they have become more flexible while still being fiscally responsible. Competitive benefits and good sales incentives for top performance. Above all, innovative company with room for improvement but a lot of upside for years to come.","While behind the curve in being channel friendly for partners, there is still a ton of upside in growing the partner community as Zebra has a highly desirable product line. There is still a big learning curve in how to develop the channel which can make basic industry practices more time consuming due to company's inexperience in having set Channel practices in place. I will give credit that there is effort and open communication in how to improve our program. However; if you really want to accelerate your career in sales at Zebra, which you absolutely can, you will need to be highly self-motivated to learn the breadth of the portfolio and not get stuck on company issues/politics they are in the process of resolving. I think a lot of these cons come from a couple things 1.) they don't recruit enough from the channel; without channel experience they often lose sight in how we can be more competitive and easier for partners to work with because there is no previous experience to be empathetic with the channels needs 2.) they don't tend to hire younger talent - the majority of employees have been in this industry 20-30 years, if they want to continue to accelerate in tech, they need to start opening more opportunities for younger talent to come in, from the channel, to provide fresh perspective.","Continue to be involved and I challenge you to meet with partners who are not your top 10 to really understand how the partner community engages with competitors and other product lines within the channel. You will not get fresh perspective until you hear from potential prospects what their challenges are; do not be afraid to ask the hard questions. This is not a negative approach, this an approach to take a step in the right direction."

There's always a challenge around the next corner, a new problem to solve, or a new product to get to market.  Management has been very good about allowing people time to attend to their personal lives, including working from home whenever that is possible. This flexibility makes it more likely for you to want to work harder and easier for you to put in extra time on those occasions where a project is running full steam ahead toward major deadlines. Good job reviews lead to nice yearly raises. Award and patent plaques line the engineering hallways.  Zebra recently made a more liberal vacation policy that allows people up to 4 weeks off per year, plus a week of sick time per calendar year. The benefits through Blue Cross/Blue Shield are decent, as are the vision and dental benefits. As you could imagine, they would all be better if they were free, but they're still not too bad.  It can be nice to be a big fish in a small pond. Because Zebra is a smaller company, you frequently get chances to work outside of your job description to meet new customer or market demands. Overall, we have great products and incredibly talented people, making this one of the best places to work.","Zebra is a little top-heavy with upper management, who seems to be making decisions solely to please stock holders, not to keep the best employees. A few managers who have been in engineering forever can be jerks, and they have a relatively high turnover compared to other managers.   Zebra is in the process of moving manufacturing to China, so people in engineering are not 100% sure if they will have jobs in a year or two. That has led to a bit of a decrease in morale in the last year.

In addition, the new incentive program guidelines showcase favoritism toward legacy Motorola employees (disparity between legacy Zebra and Motorola target bonuses that will not level set until 2018). Other issues legacy Zebra folks continue to face since the acquisition include poor treatment and disrespect as well as obvious bias of legacy Motorola employees by management within their own teams.    It is truly shameful and disappointing that this is the current state of Zebra, because it used to be a wonderful collaborative place to work.

Gave bonuses to ALL Managers & up, and ALL the Motorola acquisitions! While ONLY leaving out the ""workers"" (non-management, and majority of staff) from Zebra! Initially thought it was a mistake. Then it quickly turned into a lot of upset people. Their ""fix"" after the huge backlash was to give the left out Zebra folks a very small percentage of their salary, IF they were eligible for it. Not more than a couple percent. Never heard of such a thing. Horrible, horrible business decision! Not the best way to keep up team morale. Although, the team I was on had NO team morale! Not even friendly or civil to one another! Looked for ways to back stab the person next to them. Horrible, completely backwards training. Department changed managers 4 times in 1 year. Very uncomfortable, negative work environment to be in. Difficult to obtain answers to questions. If something might be wrong, fingers start pointing immediately, and blaming of someone. Many of the original Zebra folks unsure of their job and future. Very tense environment. They keep changing Mgr's and Sr Mgr's, and then they change the staff and so on.","Get a better grasp on the departments you have left there. Do some team building activities. Be honest and fair with the folks who are still there. Stop outsourcing departments to other countries and states.

Also am lucky that the Director for my team is knowledgeable, good to work for and well rounded with work-life balance. The office building in Lincolnshire is very nice, like a Crystal Palace (pro and con). Zebra also has a wonderful shuttle bus service from Deerfield and Highland Park train stations for those commuting from Chicago or far out suburbs. Some of the other benefits are fairly normal, they do offer tuition reimbursement which is nice for those who can take advantage.","There is not much career growth opportunity. I have no where to go in the company and stay on my current career path, plus Zebra is on a Hiring Freeze. The culture has taken a turn for the worst since acquisition of Motorola Enterprise Solutions. Unfortunately the poor attitudes, poor processes and mediocre upper management were kept from Motorola. There's a reason that company was not doing well, it doesn't make sense why Zebra management has decided to hold on to those reasons. If there is new hires in upper management all were from outside the company - another clue that Zebra is not interested in their own employee career growth. Icing on the proverbial cake is that Zebra decided to expand their bonus program, sounds great right? wrong...those that were on the program (all levels of managers, pre-acquisition Motorola managers and individual contributors, all of which were already in the program) remain eligible for their Bonus and Merit Increase for 2015 performance; those that were just added Legacy Zebra individual contributors (about 1800 people) are not eligible for Bonus nor are they eligible for a Merit Increase for 2015 performance.  Seems to me that unless you were already in Zebra Management or Pre-Acquisition Motorola you have it good, but not if you were an original individual contributor at Zebra. My sentiments are echoed on the internal site, in social media and right here on glassdoor.com  Also, don't let them fool you...Zebra is NOT a Tech company, they are a manufacturing company who outsource jobs.","Do not forget who got you to where you are now, some of your employees that are affected by your decisions have been with Zebra 20+ years.

Still a very big us vs them attitude with legacy Zebrans complaining about "" Moto attitude and perks"" and legacy Motorolans complaining about ""Zebra complacency and lack of process"". Company tries to bring in new culture but in doing so just makes everyone mad. Recent ""title harmonization"" project is ridiculous. Titles don't make sense and in many cases seem like a demotion over previous titles/positions. Also a recent announcement in bonus and merit increases created major backlash resulting in Executives to retract and change it. The damage was done though. There is little room for real advancement in many corporate areas due to old boys club and family/friends mentality. Many high level managers don't have leadership or department knowledge and some have never managed before but are connected so they get the position. Too much micro management is allowed from the top down and focus is high on many mundane items instead of truly creating One Zebra. Work life balance is slim to none due to massive project load. Working while on PTO is the norm but very little appreciation or reward from management. Continued layoffs, so called culture projects and declining stock prices push morale to a low. There is a steady flow of great talent leaving on their own as there are so many better options out there. One of their new tag lines to employees is providing a culture to retain top talent. Zebra you sure missed the mark on this one.","You SAY you want one culture and one Zebra. Act like it! Stop hiring all your consultant friends as top level managers. Stop creating a bigger divide between Moto and Zebra folk with your ridiculous culture changes and instead, why not give benefits that were better than both Moto and Zebra and really be a company that attracts, and KEEPS top talent."

Too much favoritism with regards to promotions instead of qualifications. Middle Managers tend to be ill-equipped, lazy and unwilling to do the right thing. Sadly, there are several higher level executives who are the same. Way too many egos, biases and female-unfriendly behaviors on the part of men in middle and upper management. It's a shame really. From what I saw, all of the customer-facing, truly demanding, service-oriented, bottom-line impacting roles were held by women who never received credit or recognition. Whereas the strategic and decision-making roles were held by men (men's club mentality). Men and Women alike commented on this so it was obvious to all employees.  Often times the choice was about quick and dirty solutions versus efficient and clean solutions (no one EVER circled back to correct unless a customer screamed REALLY loud). Doing it right the first time actually costs less in the long run. Customer should have been King but were often left out of decisions.  Lastly, since acquiring Motorola Solutions, far too many skilled and competent legacy Zebra employees were eliminated and/or forced to leave by their new ""Motorola"" team leaders. It was clear that Zebra was swallowed up. No one seems to have any real skin in the game any more.","Step back and look at what you are doing with a mind towards improving, building and growing the Zebra brand and culture rather than trying to become a Zebra striped version of Motorola Solutions.

Most of the time, you will not be bringing any of your work home with you or even go past your 8:30-5 schedule.","- No guidance is given to how to do your job. I was placed down and told to ask my coworkers on what to do. My coworkers all were busy and weren't interested in helping me. The only person that did help was a guy who didnt know much himself dispite being there for 3 years.  - Promise for advancement yet no one there has seen anyone move up. The longest contractor there stayed 5 years without promotion when he deserved it.  - Actual full-time employees treat contractors as the black sheep and actively avoid them. I once asked an employee for help and they purposely gave me the wrong information. I only learned it was intentional later on when an old college buddy was hired full time and told me the distaste there was for contractors.  - If you are 5 minutes late, they will dock 5 minutes from your pay, but if you have to stay late to finish a test run, then you will not be compensated for that. There is no making up missed time. you start at 40hr/wk and any little slip will only deduct the amount of time you can claim that week, even if made to work after hours.  - New monitoring software being build in-house is being used to ""stream line"" QA tests but in reality was used to monitor how much work a worker did. It was also very inaccurate since some tests can take a few minutes to a few hours to complete with only initial input from the worker, resulting in the monitor saying you were idle for 15 minutes at a time. This made it look like the worker did no testing during that time when in fact they were monitoring the test providing the required bar-codes to be scanned in as the program continued.","Actually show interest in your contractors and tell them what they need to do instead of relying on the underpaid, uninterested coworkers of said contractor."

It consisted of 2 rounds: 1) HR interview  2) Behavioural interview  Both the process was quite smooth. I got the offer letter in less than a month of applying for the position. They have great benefits including multi sport card, food discounts, free coffee. A very flexible work life and they also allow you to do home office.","My main concern sprouts around how the management deals with their employees. My training consisted of a one hour session on my second day of work followed by throwing tickets and projects along my way when I didn't even understand how the system worked. Also, there is no transparency or open communication between the team manager and subordinates. I was on a temporary contract and I constantly asked if the contract can be extended to my manager to get an idea of where I'm standing. My manager knew from the start that they couldn't extend my contract although I'm progressing and learning quite well and exceeding the KPI expectations due to the fact that the team count is low and they just wanted someone to do the excess load for the time being. I do understand most managers wouldn't want to reveal this to a new employee. However, the problem blew out of proportion when my manager spoke to my colleague explaining he cannot extend my contract but at the same time told me he needs more time to make a decision.  Also, my team members always spoke in czech and didn't speak in English though they could. Hence, I felt left out. I did raise these concerns to my manager who casually said ""the guy before you had bigger problems because of language barrier and he was guy and the other team members were girls"".  One more tactic that zebra technologies uses is giving you short contracts for 6 months or 9 months. So even if you extend your contract, you are unable to ask for a pay raise. Hence you are stuck in the same position with the same basic salary for the next 2 years. Hence, I decided to search for a new opportunity and resigned before the end of my probation period. Thankfully I found a great opportunity with a higher pay rate in about 2 weeks.","I'd suggest to hire better team leaders and managers. One of the major issues with the organization is the hiring process should be improved. I have worked in the past with MNCs and had to opportunity to work with amazing managers. Most of the employee complain about the managers in zebra technologies. Always remember that employee retention can be maintained with a good manager and work ethics. People don't leave organizations, they leave their bosses."

They will send you one communciation and after that return to their old ways of doing things. So, since all of key product managers are in the US this happens all the time across all of the product ranges. It also becomes frustrating when you make suggestions to improve things and since it didn't originate on their homeland they pay little attention to your concerns. It's not until a product gets put on ""stop ship"" that they begin to try and listen to your suggestions on what needs to be done to keep from loosing the sales pipeline that's currently in place. Also, we continue to be very poor at integrating acquistions. We simply have no proven method of how to do this successfully leading to loads of meetings and paperwork that goes round in circles. Also, we are in the beginning phase of a 3 year roll out of an Oracle ERP system that is to replace 100 separate systems across or global enterprise of companies. This is being run by IT now and they are not engaging the right users early enough in the desgin phases so we know we will be left with further customisation requests after the implementation phase because non-Zebra employees are designing our user interfaces across the work environments. In the meantime, we've are not allowed to fix existing systems that need to align to the changes we've made in our business in general because they would jeopardize the big 3 year ERP rollout of being on-time and on/under budget. This is creating additional manual processes to be undetaken and the senior management won't budge in supporting any investment in minimizing these in the meantime. Thus, morale is now being affected by a lack of concern of the extra work load being asked of certain teams. In the meantime, we've been asked to drive the stock price to double in the next 3 years or $75. So far, after two quarters, we've made only negative headway on this goal. The stock is sitting, at this posting, at $30.99, which is down from it's April 1st Q2 start of $34.53. So, a lot of work to be done yet, plus alot more expense waiting to hit the books as the ERP system launches into rollout phase one in October this year. It appears that after taking prudent measured change approaches in the past, we now are trying to change the business at break-necked speed and that is making it a totally different company to work for now.","Let's make sure we've got quality products coming out of China the first time from Jabil or get rid of them and move to another company. We are hurting our market position tremendously with rubbish coming out of there that constantly has to be reworked all the time in Heerenveen. Also, we need some clear strategy on what we plan to do (eg. cannabilize) with the Swecoin printer business. We spending way to much time on creating programmes around this family of printers that cost only a few hundred EUROS and the lawsuits that we still haven't cleaned up. I think we need to admit it was a bad acquisition and get out of this game as soon as possible because no one has even put together a technical support plan for future products (no resource assigned) so that we can support it internally let alone externally once it ships. We just look plain stupid trying to answer questions about this product even now. The EMEA product team is reluctant to own it and you can't find one of them who can load the printer and demo it to a customer. All we've done is given each RSM a sales target for each of their people on Kiosks and no training except a product slide set and now we've taken away the only support the Pre-sales guys could have in Staffan so they could learn how the product works and how to demo it to potential partners/customers for sales pipeline buidling. Again, no plan to bring them up to speed to help meet the sales targets set. Are we trying to make bricks without straw here? Lastly, do the partners know we are shooting for $75 stock price yet? Do they know what we are expecting from them in the next 3 years? What are we doing to help them raise our and their games? Please, don't just say focus on verticals. That's just like saying ""sell more stuff"" in my book. We need strategies that will grow our business above the S & P companies we get bench-marked against and until we do, we won't see our stock price break out of it's funk. Yes, we are a profitable company and that is very important but we are not a highly profitalbe company by a long shot and if we keep making Swecoin type decsiions we'll be even worse."
