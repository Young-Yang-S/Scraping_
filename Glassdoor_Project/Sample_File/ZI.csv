The expectation is that you work hard but if you to you will be rewarded. This is true throughout all levels of the organization. There is constant recognition of hard work and success. Everyone is open to feedback as there is one mission in mind and that is how do we get better every single day as individuals and an organization to serve our customers/future customers better. I couldn't be more impressed with an organization. Great pay and great people.,I have not run into any yet.,Keep recognizing the hard work people are putting in and making sure they are compensated for doing it. It goes a long way that every leader in the organization sets the example on the level of hard work and excellence that is expected.

ZoomInfo is a great place to be. The work will be a challenge everyday, but the people that embrace that mindset are worth working with, for, and a pleasure to get to know - even virtually. The company recognizes continuous improvement and readily accepts feedback on all levels.","Management is struggling to keep up with communications across the company and the engineering org in particular. There does seem to be some momentum in this space and there have been improvements along the way, but they are going through some growing pains for sure. PM and Engineering have some bridges to build, but the work is being done.   Work/Life balance suffers due to the rapid pace of this growing company. Resource constraints add to the dependency on the teams. You'll need to embrace the hard work culture.",Continue to look for creative ways to share information not only across the company but on individual team levels. Spend the money on training and skills development. Choose a direction and commit to work being planned.

They are all about growth and professional/personal development and they provide a lot of opportunities to employees to reach their goals, including management training, technical courses, and internal promotions. I love that the company offers 401K and HSA matching, as well as equity to all employees. I've made so many friends here over the years, and my coworkers are so kind and helpful. The leadership team provides updates on how the company is doing and where it is heading on a quarterly basis, and they set aside time to recognize the top performers.","Since so much of our culture revolves around continuous growth and striving to be the best in our industry, there have been times where I've seen the assumption that we already are the best just taken at face value by leaders and peers. Sometimes, we need to take a step back, be honest with ourselves, and ask whether a strategy or process is really working or if we need to move in another direction. However, this issue is relatively small compared to everything I love about working at ZoomInfo.",None

Everything is round robin and you only get quality leads if you have an ""in"" with the SDR team - Pricing is about 5x of most competitors - Data quality varies greatly, making hard to sell a solution that you know has flaws - Management churns through about 10% of sales reps every quarter. I closed over $1m in ARR, coming in at 97% quota attainment and was put on a PIP for ""lack of performance"". Meanwhile reps who closed $500k are still employed. - If you weren't hired pre-aquisition of DiscoverOrg and ZoomInfo, you have no job stability. Out of my class of 10 new hires, I was the last to remain employed after only 1 year - Very low commission rates (lowest I've ever seen in sofware sales) - Commissions paid on cash collected, so you may have to wait over 6 months to get your commission on a sale. If someone doesn't pay, the sales rep turns into a bill collector - No visibility in commission calculations - At the end of the day you are just another number out of hundreds of reps - Shady agreements with high annual uplifts and automatic renewals that lock in customers against their wishes",Invest more resources into retaining your top talent sales reps. If you cared more about your employees you wouldn't have such a high churn rate. Also paying reps on cash collected is ludicrous. I've never seen another software company hold commissions hostage after you close a deal.

I have found that everyone that I have connected with in the company from the highest to the lowest levels wants to help you move the company ball forward as well as your own ball forward. The company still has a start-up vibe in that things are fast-paced and pivot. For me I thrive in this environment. Be prepared to work hard in exchange for great benefits and a positive culture. I look for passionate people who are looking to make an impact and blaze new paths. That is a great culture fit.,I haven't experienced cons yet. I guess if someone is looking for a job to check-in and out of 9-5 daily then a fast-growing company is probably not the best fit.

I have been in some version of a sales org for most of my career and this is the first company that I feel truly means what they say.

As an employee, I feel supported and heard. I never feel pressured to do something that isn't in the best interest of the customer and even though they are here to make money they do it because they are selling a solid product and they care for all parts of this business. They do what they say and they are always working to be better. The upward mobility is also INSANE I love this job. Apply you won't regret it.","There is a required test in order to be interviewed.

It feels nice to be a part of a company that outwardly appears successful.,- The Scare tactics to drive productivity and compliance from the top down are unlike anything I've seen before.  - Forget providing constructive feedback and expecting anything to change. - The desire to cut costs at the expense of employee well-being (ie instituting such a restrictive travel budget that reps are staying in hostels in the ghetto and getting bed bugs WHILE TRAVELING FOR WORK) -After being downright LIED to multiple times I stopped believing my leaderships explanation for anything. - they think it doesn't make it through the grapevine that they do shady things with our customer's data via the chrome extension and certain integrations - This company lives for appearances and optics instead of caring about doing the right thing and doing right by their employees. - It will wear on your mental and physical health. They don't care if you are flat out 8 hours a day. Platitudes about their understanding is all you will get. There is such a high turn over rate that you might have a team of 15 but only 10 are fully ramped at any given time - Managers will gossip to you than ABOUT you without batting an eye.,I gave you my advice for years and nothing came of it.

ZoomInfo,ZI, WA,Vancouver,"March 21, 2021",,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,,5.0,,Current,,,, Current Tenured Employee ,"Recommends, Positive Outlook, Approves of CEO",full time,,,,,More than 5 years,,,"For context, I've been at ZoomInfo a few years now, so I've seen a great many things here in that timeframe. Use that as a reference point as you read this review.  High Standards - This IS a place where, should you come join us, you are expected to work extremely hard. However it's NOT hard work simply for the sake of working hard, but hard work because that IS what it takes to be number #1 in our industry. We are building a business that is growing at ~50% a year and doing so profitably. That doesn't just happen. It requires hiring smart people, challenging them with interesting work, giving them opportunities to succeed, and rewarding them for doing so. What that means practically is that we have high expectations for everyone here: ourselves, our peers, and our managers. I personally like that environment, but I realize it is not for everyone. However, in my mind, such an environment is certainly a PRO. I've been in a place that was not growing and where the culture was less energetic, and I would not go back to such a situation. It is much better to be at a place that is growing than one that is not.  Support - We also care about each other here. I have personally seen team members and executives step in with their personal money to help out an employee who suffered a near devastating tragedy. What really struck me was not necessarily that people chipped in, but that people who didn't even know this person chipped in, purely out of the goodness of their hearts. I will also say that, across multiple managers, I have always felt supported in my career and acknowledged for my contributions to my team and to the firm.   Opportunity - There are so many opportunities here. Related to my first point, our rate of growth affords us the luxury of constantly generating new roles and career opportunities as new challenges arise across the business every day. I literally have seen whole new teams spun up practically overnight to enable us to respond to market changes, just like I've seen dozens (yes, dozens) of new roles created in my time here as well. These new teams and roles provide a myriad of paths for people to take in the firm, and I've seen people accelerate their careers by doing so.   Career Growth - I can personally say that I am in a much better place career-wise than I was before I joined ZoomInfo. I feel as if this place is a ""finishing school"" for how to be a high performing SaaS company in our present day economy, and I am thankful to be a part of it. I personally know people who have left for other SaaS companies who have told us that what they learned here put them so far ahead of their peers in their new roles, which I think is one of the best compliments there is.  I will say in conclusion that I believe personal narratives are the gold standard for reviews such as these. As such, I have recommended to friends that they join this company (and they have), so hopefully that indicates that I am practicing what I am preaching.","We have flaws, just like everyone else.   Facilities - Our facilities are really not very nice. They certainly suffice, but I think we can be better than that. Though this might be less important in a more remote working world.   Workloads/stress - This is a corollary to the PRO I talked about above. We as a firm could probably be a bit more cognizant of the stresses people feel here, but I think to some extent it also what one signs up for. So this is probably more about making sure people understand that things will be intense here when they come onboard, so that they are not surprised when it actually occurs.",None

It will save you from some MAJOR headaches. - Authoritarian style leadership in some groups, not receptive to feedback or guidance. This comes from the top, so it's the rule, though there are wonderful exceptions. - Sales comes first, second, and third in all things. Some companies are run by their engineering department, some by their science/research departments, ZI is run with a mind-numbingly heavy hand by their sales department.","Sadly, if revenue is coming in the door, the will to change anything without some sort of legal ramification is near zero, and I think everyone understands that. It's tragic but most people these days are realists I think. I hope if the the recent Super Bowl taught us anything it's that losing good talent has consequences. So if I'm HR, I really try to find my backbone and broach what I see is inappropriate before more people suffer."

The way that we solve problems and generate growth is constantly improving... and even people who did one thing one way 12 months ago, continue to grow and may have a completely different (and usually better) method now.

From supportive management, to people who actually care about the product they deliver, to growth opportunities.

I am sorry that happened; it just has not been my experience. But one thing ZoomInfo tries to do is hire people at all stages of their career. When you are young with little to no job experience outside of a part time college job or volunteer experience, and you want to be handled with kitten gloves, well we do not do that at ZoomInfo. At all levels, you are pushed to always be your best. That is not toxic, that is a sign of an amazing leadership team with a strong vision for continued growth. And it is why we are one heck of a sales and marketing organization. The complaints on hours in sales and the December drive forward tells me people writing these reviews clearly have never worked anywhere else. I have. Sales for almost 15 years.

I understand hard work and needing to put in the effort but being a hamster on a wheel was not what I signed up for.  •The art of being human in sales has been lost, ZoomInfo forces you to “drink the kool-aid” and don’t fight back even when your KPI’s are often increased each month •Sales is the most important division of this company, if you don’t work in sales you won’t get the supper you’re seeking.","CEO Henry Schuck loves to use this analogy of not being the Pittsburgh Pirates who are perpetual losers and don’t do a lot to contend year over year. Instead, he will compare us to the Boston Red Sox who have won the World Series twice in the last decade.... the problem with this analogy is ZoomInfo has turned into the 2021 Red Sox, a team that will cut cost and trade players to get under the luxury tax. The same can be said about ZoomInfo, invest back in your employees and make them feel appreciated and compensated for their work instead of driving people away and wanting to play for a different team as what happened to me. This company could be a great one to work for if it changed it culture back to one that made every department feel valued and compensated."

With disrespectful management that is looking to score points with their bosses at the expense of making you work nonstop, the Marketing and GTM teams at ZoomInfo are bringing back slavery back to corporate America that Lincoln and MLK raised their voice against.

On the surface, everyone seems driven, and ready to succeed; however, if you take a deeper look , you get the sense that there's a gun pointed at the back of everyone's head. And they feel it every day.   This seems like it stems from the very top. A previous reviewer already mentioned it, but the Pirates/RedSox comparison has been brought up multiple times since I've started here. The general sentiment from leadership is ""work above all else."" I've heard the stories of not having a holiday party, about the game tables and other amenities being removed post acquisition, about team outings cut down. I'm at the stage of my career where I don't even look to those as needed perks to have at a company, but I certainly understand others do. There should be an attempt by leadership to show you value your most valuable resource (your employees). With the world we live in today, I think this is even more important. Employees should be encouraged to take time off and unplug. No one is going to die if ZoomInfo doesn't respond to them for a few hours.. Yet it's stated every meeting, every day that, if you don't work today, you better work doubltime tomorrow and the next day, or else we will all miss our number.  We preach being an efficient and tactical go-to-market machine, yet the processes behind the scenes are extremely confusing and seem to turn off most customers. Automated emails (most will be sent in the sales rep's name) are constantly hitting our customer base/prospects. This is happening while we're also running our own manual ""blitzes"" / general outreach. It can make it challenging to be a strategic sales rep. when all of your customers are fatigued by the barrage of communication they receive. And, as mentioned above, all this motion seems to stem from the internal messaging that ""we need to stay above pace"" or ""we are just at pace or lagging behind."" It really is strange. Again, any given day you would get the impression that if we took even a day off ZoomInfo is going out of business.   I would recommend sorting these reviews by ""recent"" and reading through them that way. A lot of the negative reviews get covered up by default. You'll also see the trend of extremely positive reviews following any negative ones. I can also confirm that new hires are encouraged to post reviews on Glassdoor during their final week of training, which just seems strange. You do not have a true sense of the company (any company) until much later on.   To those that are looking to come over, check that the person who is referring you has been there for longer than their ramp period. I would say that it will also depend on who your manager is, but it truly does seem that no department or team here is spared from the boiler-room mentality coming down from the top.  And for those that have been there for some time - I promise you - there are better options out there.","Back to the baseball analogy - If you're concerned about employees not being championship caliber players 24/7, I would suggest you take a look at the multiple ""daily stand ups"" we take part in (I have on average 10 hours of internal meetings a week). Most of the content in these meetings could be summarized in an email. So we are probably on average losing 1 day a week/rep. across the entire sales team (10 hour days are the norm)."

There are some great, smart people here, and my direct management team was excellent. The product is top shelf.","ZoomInfo is a boiler room that uses fear and intimidation over engagement and inspiration to motivate their employees. As other reviewers mentioned, there was a layoff at the beginning of the pandemic to set the tone for everyone that nothing is more important than work, and the company does not care what else is going on in the world. Employees are stressed out and the feedback internally is the company is “tone deaf”.  Revenue and stock price are all that matters at ZoomInfo. If you aren’t willing to sacrifice work/life balance you don’t belong here. For example, the company will advertise “unlimited vacation”, which sounds great. Then you get in the door and learn that the first and last week of every month are “blackout periods” where you can’t take time off, so there goes half the year. If you don’t hit your numbers every month, get ready to be put on plan; so really, don’t even think about taking time off. Not to mention that everyone there is overworked to begin with, so if you do take time off there is a guilt factor that someone else, who is already stretched beyond bandwidth, has to cover for you. Another example is the obnoxious, unproductive 8am “stand up” calls they insist upon, that serve no function other than to get you in front of your computer. You have kids homeschooling because of the pandemic and you need to make sure they’re off and running? Too bad. Get to work, slacker. Compassion is for losers.  Don’t be fooled by the cut-and-paste employer responses on all these negative posts saying how they care about improving employee engagement and prompting reviewers to email them at a general mailbox. The company breeds a culture of stress and fear so why would anyone send a critical email to a general mailbox? Should they just make the subject line “fire me”? Besides, these issues are not new – the negative reviews all say the same thing and stretch back over a year – read them all, you’ll see a theme. Clearly, these are not issues the company is willing or able to correct.","As other reviewers have stated, it seems pointless to provide advice to leadership, since they are so much smarter than everyone else. However, this pandemic will end, the job market will recover, and people will find places willing to treat them with respect. You will lose talent which will negatively affect customer satisfaction. Unhappy customers lead to unhappy shareholders. Stop saying you have a great culture and do the work of creating a great culture. *Pro tip: don’t have executive leadership send all-company emails broadly stating that people don’t work hard enough (when they are already past capacity) and need to stop complaining. It’s insulting, demoralizing, and was a major reason I ultimately decided to leave this poisonous atmosphere."

Public shaming and intimidation occur often from management - and theres no shame in it on their part because it happens out in the open during meetings. A manager will openly dress down a colleague while the rest of us uncomfortably wait for it to be over and pray that the vile spewing doesn’t get pointed at someone else. There’s nothing like watching a VP-level person have a temper tantrum like a child to make you really wish you worked anywhere else.   It’s also true that there is absolutely no work/life balance. Employees exist to work themselves silly and then either burn out and quit, or be laid off due to vague or bogus reasons. It is a daily occurrence to get Slack messages at all hours with the expectation that you need to reply/be available. I’ve had to join calls on a weekend because someone in management decided it was a fake emergency that needed to be addressed ASAP. You have a family or other commitments? Too bad.   One note about “unlimited” PTO: no one is allowed to take time off during the entire month of December. It is a company policy that makes no sense until you realize that it’s because we do everything last-minute. You’re trapped at work during a month when the rest of the world is winding down to enjoy the holiday season with family and friends.   There is a common saying that “we move fast” at ZoomInfo. Speed comes at a cost of precision and quality. Mistakes are common because people don’t have time to think. Just do - and do faster. Everything suffers because of the poor quality of the work output but hey at least you beat that arbitrary deadline!   These issues exist across the company, not just in Sales. Marketing, Product, GTM and others are all guilty of poor behavior and bad managers who think it’s okay to be unprofessional, spiteful, and outright mean to employees. The culture is broken and it is not okay.","Dear HR, it’s nice that you respond to reviews here but no one is going to out themselves by emailing you.

This is the most toxic culture I have ever witnessed in my professional career. Upper leadership has absolutely no clue how to manage employees. Work life balance is non existent in all departments; told us we were expected to work until midnight New Year’s Eve to close deals and told reps they needed people to work Thanksgiving. On top of that, management doesn't care about your wellbeing or mental health. People are guilted about taking time off, and are texted or called when they are off asking about the status of their deals. on the last day of the month leadership volunteered all managers to be available all night to close deals. This puts those with families and a life outside of this company in a very difficult position.   Bullying in the workplace is part of the culture. Management reveals confidential information about other employees, complains about them behind their back, and/or makes fun of them as if we are in high school. They also believe fear based motivation is the way to go - putting people on display in front of hundreds of their peers and criticizing them to the point of embarrassment. It is a shame because the product is decent but the individuals they put in leadership roles diminish everything. The entire company is a walking clone of each other.. Profit over people is true in previous reviews. Please consider taking a job here and only do so if you are desperate. Keep in mind - they love to cover their negative reviews with fake positive ones to keep up their good ratings.","Actually put empathetic leaders who know what they are doing into management positions. Maybe consider some training about ethical business practices while you’re at it. Additionally, it would be nice to see management held accountable for their actions. Doesn't matter how many people complain, they remain in positions of power."

I regret every minute of it. Everything I'd heard about the inept management, racist/homophobic culture, and toxic frat house vibe of the business was horribly true. On my first week I witnessed a manager tell my coworker that ""lunch is for losers"" (not sarcastically) when she requested to take a lunch break. The ""lunch/breaks are for losers"" phrase was commonly said over Slack by many other managers, so... the idea of work-life balance is non-existent. Sales employees are REQUIRED to work over national holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas (for no additional pay) simply because management says so. On the subject of management, there are a handful of people in leadership positions who openly mock, shame, belittle, and bully employees for their own pleasure. This behavior is not only accepted by other managers, it is encouraged and celebrated as being ""tough love"". Company rules are constantly changing but never properly articulated to the employees, which creates a constant state of chaos and disarray. Worst of all, there is NO JOB SECURITY. ZoomInfo churns on a vicious cycle of working Sales employees to the bone, getting them to the point of promotion, and then firing them so they can do the same thing to a new sales staff every 6 months. Employees are disposable and it's despicable. Do not believe any positive review you read on here - they are all phony, orchestrated by the HR department to drown out the noise of truthful reviews like these. While I was working there I was asked to submit a 5 star review on here to ""help build company clout"" and I refused because I could not in good conscious say something positive about this business. This is a horrible soul sucking job run by terrible people - do not work here unless your only other option is to beg for money on the street.

I loved everyone I worked closely with.,"I'll start with their handling of COVID-19. They laid off around 100 or so people around April 2020, despite the business facing NO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP due to the pandemic. They went public two months later, for god's sake - they were fine. So they opted they put dozens of people out of work in the middle of a massive financial crisis for no reason? After we saw our coworkers disappear from Slack and were understandably nervous, they never fully explained the layoffs. It was addressed MONTHS later in a sentence or two in a Q&A email. I think it's disgusting that they used COVID-19 as an excuse to ""trim the fat"" when the business was actually thriving. It's just one example of ZI leadership caring about people more than profit (despite putting ""we're successful because of our people!"" all over social media).   I'll add one other point - there are a handful of people leading the company who are certifiably bad people. It's almost a joke among the employees - ""oh, do not cross so-and-so, he will actually try to make you cry"". Maybe you won't have to deal with these people in your own work, but do you want to work at a company that allows this behavior to continue?   HR clearly doesn't care about serious workplace complaints when it comes to certain individuals. It sends the message - it's fine for certain leaders to create a hostile work environment as long as they're making the business tons of money.   These are just a couple of problems out of many, but if I wrote about everything it would be a novel. Believe the negative reviews, and don't take the positive ones at face value. Many of these were left because an HR rep pressured them to leave positive reviews - I actually left a 5-star review because of this a while back.",HR leadership needs an ethical overhaul.

When it comes to promotions, they are solely based on who has performed previously at a high level, but not based on their ability to teach and develop those working for them. It is very much a ""do as I say"" type of environment.",Have clear communication among all 3 of the primary locations and don't mix the messages up to the employees or undermine each other on a management level. Be transparent on what is going on so employees don't create their own stories and rattle the culture.

ZoomInfo,ZI, WA,Vancouver,"April 15, 2020",Covid_19,Helpful,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,Current,,,, Anonymous Employee,"Doesn't Recommend, Negative Outlook, Disapproves of CEO",full time,,,,,More than 5 years,,,"I have worked at ZoomInfo for 5+ years. Around fall of 2018 the ""pros"" started disappearing. By February 2019, when ZoomInfo was acquired by DiscoverOrg, the company was no longer recognizable. So, long story short, the only ""pros"" that still exist are some of the kind, smart, hardworking people that haven't been forced out/fired yet. But these employees are great DESPITE ZoomInfo, not because of ZoomInfo.","Leadership does not believe in work/life balance and it's openly looked down on if you leave work at 5:00 pm- regardless of your professional impact on the organization. You'll often see people working until 8 or 9 pm simply because it's expected of them/they feel guilted into it. This outlook, along with many other questionable policies (both spoken and unspoken) puts parents, families, and people working multiple jobs at a clear disadvantage. This dynamic also shows a complete disregard for the mental health of employees.   The CEO cares far more about his own ego, his own money, and talking about his own accomplishments than he cares about the employees who helped get him where he is today. He seems to let his emotions rule his decisions and regularly lets his own pride cloud his judgment. It is my opinion, that he is in over his head and is not equipped to maintain a competitive business long term- made evident by the unrelenting control he attempts to exert over every aspect of the business- down to the most insignificant details.   In my personal experience, HR practices seem questionable at best, immoral and corrupt at worst. In recent months, it appears that many top performers have been let go after voicing concerns or pushing back against inhumane business practices. Those of us left never know where we stand and feel like we can't voice our opinions about things like working conditions, workplace bullying, unfair policies, discrimination and more.   There appears to be a certain level of confusion and toxicity across all departments, and in my experience, it's not isolated to any particular group of people. In my experience, professional growth is a myth at ZoomInfo. It seems like anyone who shows the tiniest bit of potential is exploited, overloaded with work, expected to make up for other employees' shortcomings, and the second they object to any of these asks, they're told they have a bad attitude. Once someone is completely disillusioned and burnt out, they're let go or pushed to the back burner and replaced by someone less jaded.  Employees seem to have no control over the work they do. Upper management tends to get involved in the smallest of decisions, often at the last minute, and expect entire teams to pivot months' worth of work to accommodate personal preferences or big egos. In conversations among current and past employees, this seems to be cited as the main reason for the lack of motivation a lot of us are feeling. How can you expect employees to take pride in their work when they have no say over how or what they do?  I am not understanding the person in previous reviews who addressed the handling of the COVID situation, perhaps they work in a different location or they managed to have been shielded from the worst of it.  The handling of the COVID-19 situation is actually what prompted me to write this review. In my opinion, to call it egregious, immoral, corrupt, and dangerous would be an understatement. During the beginning of the situation, an official company email was distributed saying none of the offices were located in high-risk areas, despite new cases mounting within a 10 mile radius daily.   I have several roommates and a handful of friends that were all allowed to work from home weeks before we got the go ahead to do so. But again, this was optional, and several key members of the leadership team seemed frustrated by the ""inconvenience"".   Two weeks after all neighboring companies had been working from home, I had to drive by the office on my way to a doctor appointment and was shocked to see the parking lot half full.  It is my opinion, that based on the conversations I've had with my colleagues and several of the people I manage, that there was a lot of fear and uncertainty about working from home. Because the choice was initially put on us, we were afraid of retribution or professional consequences if we actually worked from home. From what I understand, several people brought this concern to their superiors and the general sentiment was, it's safe to go into work, a lot of people are still working, but if you personally don't want to or if you're scared, feel free to work from home.  On top of this pressure- whether that pressure was perceived or real- once it was clear we should be all working from home, employees were strongly encouraged by leadership to work extra hours ""since you're no longer commuting""   A company wide email also instructed employees that unless we had existing PTO on the calendar, we could no longer use our unlimited PTO during the pandemic. People with children or sick relatives were encouraged to figure something out with HR.  Members of the leadership team have recently been posting on social media touting the fact that we haven't had any layoffs. But, just this week more than 100 people (an estimate, since there wasn't much internal communication about this) were let go. The little information we got about the situation was basically a canned response about reducing inefficiencies. But, when management was pressed about whether it was related to economic downturns or performance issues, I was given a weird mumbled generic non-response about it being both. Yet, we're still all over social media bragging that we're still hiring. I find that odd. The ""trim the fat"" comment left by another reviewer really rings true to me.   Employees who have every reason to stay are walking away from ZoomInfo frequently, often without notice. The tension is mounting and leadership continues to exert extreme, weird control over us.   It's worth noting that, in the past, employees have been strongly ""encouraged"" to leave positive reviews here. I also find it extremely coincidental that anytime a negative review surfaces, a handful of positive, cheery reviews all posted within the same general time period will bump it downward.   My word of advice, don't be fooled by the good reviews, the arcade games (yes they were actually unplugged following the acquisition), the office studio/gym, or the fun murals. This place is utterly toxic... in my opinion.","Treat your people better. Consider what your values are. Trust the people you hire to do their jobs. Reign in members of senior leadership who regularly berate, belittle, and humiliate staff because they've lost control of their own emotions. Walk away if you're given the opportunity."

Like any company, there have been bumps in the road but the positives outweighed any of the negatives. The product is best in class, people are wonderful, and the opportunity ahead made the grind worthwhile.","All of this changed with COVID-19. ZoomInfo's true colors came through and no matter who you are at the company, how well you've done, or what you may be dealing with on a personal levels... does not matter. In fact, I don't think they even see you as a person at this point.   Life outside of work? Is that a thing? You are expected to work 10+ hours a day. The day begins with getting bombarded on every deal and hammered that we are not doing enough. ""Slow day. Need to do more. Get business now. We are behind. Do more. You will be working weekends if we don't hit our number. Don't get coffee. Start work now. You are disappointing the business."" Sounds like a great way to start the day. Right? As a very motivated individual... threats are the worst way to motivate a sales team.  I've gone back and forth on writing this review for a couple of months since my experience for the past 4 years has been positive. However, people need to know that when it comes down to it, you are just a number and your mental health or who you are as a person, does not matter to them. This is already a very challenging time for everyone and how they are treating their employees is detrimental to our mental health.",You have a stellar sales team that work harder than any other team I've been a part of. Stop threatening them as a way to motivate them so you can hit board numbers... take it back to basics and treat your people better.

The end result has been the development and launch of a truly incredible product which very much works. Unfortunately, along the way the company has assumed DiscoverOrg's corporate identity which completely shifted the ZoomInfo culture and work environment. The real problem with this is the hard work and dedication that goes into the development, support, and sales of this product goes completely unnoticed by leadership as they are always expecting and pushing for more. Leadership works everyone like dogs all while making constant changes, incorporating new processes, goals, deadlines and metrics that they want to see achieved without taking into consideration the real bandwidth of their employees' work capacity. Benefits are relatively limited for such a fast growing company and they haven't indicated any plans of providing stock options to employees who have no vested equity in the company. Leadership also constantly keeps employees in the dark about what is going on with decision making and they tend to drop huge announcements/changes on people with little-to-no consideration for the impact that they will have on their job, performance and morale. Company culture sucks. They don't offer company sponsored events or any fun activities outside of work (didn't even have a holiday party in 2019) and people are so focused on ""hitting their number"" that there tends to be a ""keep your head down and work"" culture that yields little employee engagement or enjoyment amongst co-workers.","Create more of a fun culture.

The facilities is beautiful and easy to get to off I-95. I never had trouble getting to the old office, or the current office.   They’re flexible about working from home — there are people who work completely remotely, people that work 2-3 days at home, and people that work solely in the office. This mostly depends on your manager, but the completely is relaxed about it as a whole. They also are flexible about when you’re in the office. Again, depends on your manager but I’ve seen people come in at 10/11am and as long as they work 8 hours a day, they’re fine.   The people here are fantastic. I’ve made some long last friendships here, and genuinely enjoy almost everyone I work with.","Benefits changing — we got an awesome 401K match in January (when executives were privately working on the acquisition) and then had it quickly downgraded when we were acquired. If you had stock in the company, you got what was already vested and then the rest would be paid out over the course of the next 2 years. I’m not sure if that’s standard, but it definitely makes people feel like they HAVE to stay which definitely lowers morale.   Everything seems to be focused on going public next year, which is great because more things are getting done by the book and being documented well but there’s just change after change after change, with not a lot of directive.   There’s a lot of animosity between each department. Sales doesn’t like finance. Finance doesn’t like engineering. Marketing doesn’t like anyone. We’re one company. We’re all here for the same reason, we all have the same goal.   That leads to communication — there is none. No one has any idea what’s going on. It’s not just interdepartmental, NO ONE has any idea what’s going on, until after the fact. Managers (in all departments) need to do a better job of addressing changes and concerns, before and as they happen.","Start focusing on your employees, instead of going public.

Not sure if someone else here wrote it, or I heard it somewhere else, but it probably is true that a brilliant, but heavily focused on tech, founder/ CEO let himself fall too in love with his solution and not with the problem he was trying to solve.

Markets. I wondered why we pursued some markets, abandoned others, then tried to recoup, etc etc. I think this came more from the problem of having too many options with what to do with the data - we never felt incredibly, deeply focused on one bright goal.
