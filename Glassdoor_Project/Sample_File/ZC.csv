Your yachts and mansions are more important to you than creating something of true value. When all you seek is to please the share holders so you can get your bonuses, you gut the company. Zodiac Aerospace can be such a huge powerhouse in the industry. We can be 10 times more successful if you had the vision for it. Set up realistic long term goals and invest in the company. It'll pay off greater dividends than whatever you're getting now. Pay your people what they deserve and keep the product in-house. Actually honor your commitments to our customers and don't drop quality just because you think you can shave off a little more profit in the short term. And for goodness' sake, make the work place safer. I see production people sanding in a closed environment without proper masks. All that dust they're breathing in is not healthy. I don't feel any better about it given that engineers also breath some of that in."

Thanks. Enjoy...,"I professionally worked for Zodiac Aerospace for almost 8 months. This Company has ties with The Boeing Company which my father and other family members are respected employees of and have worked there for over 31 plus years. I was a Receptionist for the Front Desk and a Human Resources Administrative Office Assistant/ File Clerk. Unfortunately I was ""terminated"" or laid off from this company. There was no warning or notice given. My termination was extremely tacky and poorly executed. I was approached during work hours and escorted to the HR office by two HR Generalist which were my bosses at the time, where quickly and speedily termination papers were placed in front of me to sign. I was told my reason for termination was my position was no longer needed and it was nothing I did wrong and a Reference was in order for me. (Which I did not receive) I was asked to immediately clean out my desk under supervision, turn in my badge and leave the premises. To say the least I was shocked. I immediately packed up and left, the next day I relieved a call from my former Supervisor who was one of the HR Generalist and was told quote "" I'm sorry I am not comfortable giving you a reference."" I came into the office in a professional manor to discuss this unfair treatment and was told they would think about giving me a reference. My Supervisor did not like my direct approach and took it unprofessional personal and proceeded to be rude and indirect. The HR department to say the least took me through a lot of drama and indecisive issues when word was verbally spoken I would receive my reference explaining my work ethic and time I worked for the company. I have not received this still. Zodiac Aerospace is not a company I would recommend working for. They do not treat their employees with integrity and respect for professional work accomplishments. The HR department does not accept Doctors Notes and is extremely cut throat and unfair with their employees when most employees in management positions within the office are Salary and do not have the same Rules that apply to hardworking employees. Working alongside the HR Department and Company Employees in Head Positions I have experienced seeing many unfair treatments from supervisors, and management. I and many others have been verbal about the embarrassingly unprofessional behavior from the individuals within the accounting, payroll, department and other departments within this company. There is no order and professional problem solving within this company. C&D Zodiac Aerospace is not a company to work for if you want to be part of a team and valued as an employee.

Left to get on with your role with little interference as long as your performance is OK.   Overtime available on most projects, usually when approaching important milestone dates that have to be met.  Providing you do your job well, you accept that the timescales can be sometimes (read mostly) unrealistic, and you don't ruffle any feathers; promotion opportunities are real possibilities.","The company is very disorganised and inefficient resulting in last minute changes and pressure to push things through in unrealistic timescales. Communication (or lack of) is often a serious issue from the team leads, even within your own project team.  How enjoyable the role is dependant on which project you're moved onto and who is managing/leading the team.   Design methodologies are very disjointed and not coordinated very well. Little control over how internal design standards are managed.  There is a severe shortage of engineers for the amount of work we have so they have to take what they can get. This results in some engineers not capable/motivated in doing the job. This has a knock on effect of other engineers within the team having to take up the slack.  The Catia/SmarTeam system is poorly setup. Not taking the advice of consultants resulting in frustrating performance of the system. System crashes, lost work, extremely slow searches/load times are a common occurrence. Things are changing slowly but not fast enough. With aggressive timescales, this only adds to the pressure.  Lessons are not learned from failings of other projects. It feels like Groundhog Day with project after project requiring engineers to work excessive overtime because another milestone date could be missed due to the same reasons the previous 20 projects almost missed theirs!  Change as a whole is very slow within the company. With some very old school managers stuck in their ways, it's like trying to turn the direction of a big oil tanker in a stormy sea with a small wooden oar.","Communication is a real issue.
