Head count isn't always replaced when someone leaves. The company furloughed almost half of the team last year in April, and didn't bring many back. Those left worked and are still working insane hours. There is no work / life balance.  The company cares much more about business than people. This was especially apparent when they wanted us all back in the office last summer (starting in July 2020) through fall in the middle of the pandemic, even though many were uncomfortable coming into the office.  It is extremely difficult to get promoted. Many leave after only a few years because careers are at a standstill at Wolverine.  It is nearly impossible to get full bonus. Business isn't great for many brands, so budgets and resources are always being cut. They refuse to invest in the resources, people, marketing budgets, required to meet the aggressive goals set out, which makes the goals virtually unreachable. The focus is entirely on growing the web business, so if you aren't on that team, you can forget about getting any assistance or resources from the company to help you succeed at your job. New leaders are brought in constantly, as people cycle in and out of the company regularly. Every few years the direction is changing. Not a lot of vision or consistency.","Many senior leaders need serious leadership training. They don't know the first thing about motivating teams, fostering collaboration, retaining talent, or building culture. The environment is toxic, the turnover rate is appalling, and the finger pointing from the top is sad."

Yes, this year was tough because of COVID and I'm pretty sure every company that has an Ecommerce site did well in online sales but the numbers we exceeded was no accident. Ecomm had a plan and as leaders they executed along with all Ecomm specialists being on the same page, holding specialists accountable as well as themselves when something went wrong. Team mentality and team goals even though Ecomm specialists technically manage different brands. Executive Management - with a portfolio style Wolverine Worldwide has, it is tough to collaborate with all brands to be on one page which leads to unshared ideas, successes and failures. I believe this has lead to brands trying to figure it out for themselves. This is why I am suggesting taking a page out of the Ecomm team's book and learn from them. From personal experience there is a clear disconnect with ecomm, brand and product. Truly, I do think the new CEO will do great things and bring this company to its potential. He is having a big focus on ecomm but these changes will take time."

They provide many opportunities for enthusiastic, energetic and hard working people to tune their skills through coaching and training. They promote from within as far as their retail side from what I saw but are also keen on making sure the right person fits the right job so when needed they will hire from outside. I worked for their Merrell Brand and see a bright future for the Brand and the company as whole. While they are relatively young in direct consumer sales, in the 5 years I was with them they made leaps and bounds becoming more efficient in distribution, marketing and customer relations. They included their Merrell brand retail store managers in their spring brand conference where managers were able to see the coming years styles and get an insight to the direction the company was headed. They provided training for managers at this time which included things such as personality recognition for coaching and training of staff, how to effectively network and recruit and much more. This proved an invaluable tool for myself and my peers to direct our stores in the direction we needed for improvement and success.",Their yearly review did not always appreciate the hard work of the retail staff however in my last year they made GREAT changes to the review that helped recognize great employees.,"The store managers I met do a great job - they hire people who are passionate about the product they sell - they are unique - they are extreme, in their passions and sometimes their lifestyle. Dont take away this great environment by forcing employees to wear uniforms and name tags, or preventing managers from hiring a great candidate because they have non-offensive tattoos or piercings or hair colors - you are a forward thinking company, dont get stuck in the thinking of yesterday where a person's appearance decides how successful they can be."

Human resources is reactive vs being proactive very erratic behavior in terms of letting bad/unqualified employees go but somehow keeping other equally bad employees Internal talent or employees who start their career for the company get paid much less than outside talent that comes in later, even with the same skill level. the company pays based on need and not skill since nobody wants to come to rockford. also due to this same reason you can have someone come in from college or an outside company working next to an employee in the same position that worked in the mailroom or was someones assistant without any relevant degree, experience or education, in this case the pay will reflect it but its really strange and not how industry leading companies put teams together.

No doubt the experience at ""corporate"" is a whole different ball of wax.  The company is run top-down. Sales managers and associates are not solicited for feedback except in a very formal and politically correct way which leads to management getting basically meaningless information. Sales associates are evaluated based on parameters that are considered objective when they are not. In my store there was one register, and the person who ""gets the sale"" may simply be the one standing at the cash register at the time. Sales goals for the day are divided by the number of hours in the day, when sales do not occur evenly like this but more like a flattened bell-curve. This discriminates against sales associates working in off-peak hours.  Inventory control is crisis management at the onset of various buying seasons. Our stockroom aisles become absolutely filled with shipping cartons, with no room on the shelves for stocking, much less organizing the shoes. Inventory control can only work if you have room to organize; we don't at these times. You can't find shoes the customer wants, yet we are implored to ""sell, sell, sell."" Shipping cartons overflow into the sales area, or we ""store"" the shoes in a storage unit two miles away. These shoes are ""in the store,"" but they aren't accessible. They may as well be in Timbuktu.  Store associates do NOT get paid time-and-a-half for working holidays. We are told we must work them, the same as store managers. But the managers get time-and-a-half at their higher wage, while the lowest paid employees in the company get straight pay. If a sales associate works overnight before Black Friday--and we were required to be open--he gets straight time.

This is a corporation with horrible leadership through and through. It's a bunch of old men making decisions about money and ignoring the product, employees, and the consumer. When its about the dollars its not about the people and thats very clear throughout all the brands. Many horrible people who are not qualified for their roles at management, VP, and president levels. No opportunity for advancement and an HR department thats only job is to give you the run around and excuses when you ask about promotion, raises, bonuses or issues within the work place. The core values that I've really felt since being a part of this company are sexism, hypocrisy, and aversion to forward thinking people. If you are a complaisant person who wants a tiny paycheck and three jobs worth of work under a mediocre title, this is the place for you. Otherwise I would look elsewhere.","Fire your CEO. Take surveys from ALL levels of employees on each manager and leader to get a real picture of who is qualified and good at their job, and who is taking out all the potential for wolverine to succeed in the future. Fire the managers and leaders who are not qualified or horrible at their jobs and replace them. Then maybe start considering career advancement as a normal reoccurring thing instead of something employees have to beg for. Also, if you can't pay your employees fair salaries for their work then you should change things around a bit so that can happen. No young person with talent will stay at a dying company where all the bosses are threatened by them and actively try to keep them down. Show your employees you care about them with decent healthcare, a good salary, and a chance to move forward in their career without leaving."
