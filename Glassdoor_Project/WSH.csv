As someone who decidedly falls outside of the ""morning person"" category, I very much appreciated the ability to schedule my mandated 40 hours a week in any way I chose within office hours (6am to 10pm if I remember correctly) to a maximum of 10 hours a day. My location in Aurora, Colorado was somewhat secure, with employee badges used for entry at one of two entry points. Free coffee and tea, with the occasional pizza party or similar food-centric encouragement mechanism. There is large break room for the building, with 2 large fridge/freezer combos for use by employees as well as vending machines for snacks and beverages, 6 microwaves, a TV, and a variety of comfortable seating options. There is a small fitness center available to employees with two bathrooms, each with their own shower. You can claim a locker if needed. Water fountains were fitted with the extension that quickly fills water bottles. You are free to use approved mp3 players and headphones in accordance with certain regulatory guidelines (typically a device that lacks any sort of receiving or recording capability will be approved). There is a generous training period of about a month. The human resources department seemed to genuinely care about the well-being of employees and were very helpful. Employees could use the e-470 toll road and receive rebates to offset the tolls. Openings in other positions within the company were always emailed to all employees, so advancement or lateral moves are available occasionally.","The biggest issue I have is with the company policy of hiring temporary workers and keeping them on temporary status permanently. I was hired on a 3 month contract, and at the end of my contract, my direct supervisor spent all of 2 minutes to tell me to keep coming to work. This was in line with the usual supervisor interactions being short and stinted with no room for discussion. I thought I was being moved to full-time employment, but I was never afforded the benefits and compensation thereof. This means no health insurance, no 401k, no PTO, no vacation days, no health insurance, and so on. Temporary workers do accrue TTO, though its accrual is at a much slower pace than full-time employees' PTO accrual. However, this TTO must be used to cover any absence, so a single sick day can wipe out a month or more of TTO accrual. Time on the clock is heavily metered. You are allotted 5 minutes of paid break time within an hour of work, and an unpaid lunch of a minimum 30 minute duration you can place at any point in the day, so long as you don't work more than 5.5 hours consecutively. In addition, any activity that has you leave your computer was to be preceded by you clocking out on break and locking your computer, meaning that precious break time was often chipped away by office errands, bathroom breaks, and trips to the water fountain or coffee machine, with no real chance to disconnect and refresh, resulting in every day being more of a slog than any other job I've had. The rebate for the toll road usage is incredibly micro managed to the point where the company will tell you exactly where you can enter and exit the toll road while still qualifying for the rebate. There is also the oddity that you have to first pay the regular toll rate, and file a separate claim for the rebate each separate month.",None

I was told she was given a ""great package"" and that management ""really took care of her."" This individual told me she was initially given a week of pay, and she had to argue for a second week. This is despicable that this was all this person received and that I was told that this person was taken care of well. I was very disappointed with management in this lie. I know you don't know the full context, but I can tell you without a doubt that this person wasn't allowed to succeed, and this was even admitted to me by management. Also--it was told to me that management learned from this, but this wasn't an isolated event. Hindsight needs to be turned into foresight, but I don't think anyone had the help they needed to do this."

Management needs more accountability and fewer opportunities to scapegoat subordinates. Hire less white people and start practicing diversity. The demographic is embarrassingly caucasian and male, especially leadership. Encourage your business development department to step outside of the box and be receptive to new practices. Applying unreasonable branding guidelines, cookie cutter customer-facing material, and doing business as usual because ""that is always the way we've always done things"" is backward.

It was very boring and frustrating during this period but eventually other big projects came in and I started working on them and was content. One of my group members did not have an engineering degree so it's like ""what is he doing here or what am I doing here?"".  In my opinion I think it is better to work for a small firm when starting your career so that you get better experience since you would be given more responsibility and work closer with experienced engineers and will have a bigger part in the project. Then after obtaining sufficient experience after a few years it can be good to work for a big firm and manage your own group.",Only hire engineers to do engineering work.

They work on some really cool projects though, I have to give them that!","For as long as I worked there, the company was split into analysis (they just do etabs models and design shearwalls and linkbeams) and design (they just do columns, slabs, beams, foundations). Very few people in the office had the privilege to understand and do both. In the end, if you stay for too long you'd be stuck knowing only gravity design or only lateral design. All the drafting is also done by a separate department. So you never develop the real skills of a proper engineer. That is: being able to design the whole building and to draft it yourself. (That I guess should be the goal of a structural engineer right?)  Also analysis engineers are given very little exposure to clients etc. so they become sort of hens in the cage that lay etabs models instead of eggs. I liked to call their system - assembly line, rather than an engineering office. Also, hours are crazy! If I left at 8pm I felt lucky! I understand bankers and lawyers work even longer hours. But they are also paid 4 times as much!","Get rid of your analysis-design-drafting separation. Ok, one may start of in just one department and work there for a year but eventually you have to rotate them to make them more well rounded. Otherwise the talented engineers will leave you as soon as they can."

Promotions are non-existent and salaries are stagnant and often below market rate.   End-of-year reviews are nothing but glorified paper-pushing as you get an “attaboy” and a vague promise that maybe next year you’ll move up or get that raise you’ve worked so hard for. But don’t dare rock the boat to ask for what you deserve...you’ll be met with open hostility from leadership backed by the incompetent HR staff.   Marketers have no say in pursuit decisions and are treated with a general disrespect by leadership. The company is grossly mismanaged - by a group of middle-aged white men who “shush” women openly in meetings.   There is no work/life balance to speak of - get ready to work regular 12 hours days because engineering staff chases ALL opportunities without vetting them properly. There are limited resources and marketing staff is stretched to the breaking point.   Health insurance is a joke, especially their one week paid maternity leave. Leadership consistently spouts the motto “work hard, play hard,” but it’s YOU working and them playing.   If you are looking for a successful, supportive team environment - one that will support your career goals and respect your life outside of the office - this isn’t the place for you.

Vacation benefits are quite good in the sense that you are encouraged to use as much of your vacation time as you want each year. Good work-life balance - though downtime between projects means your job can get quite boring for blocks of time. The firm is a good place to begin a career - but not ideal if you plan on staying several years.,"The recent integration with WSP has led to an exodus of key leaders and talent. WSP management has noted PB's high cost base in its most recent financial report - which was reflected in low pay raises received this year by many employees across the firm. Per company policy, younger employees do not receive annual bonuses (they are only eligible for the spot bonus program - with awards minimal in amount).  The company is very silo-ed and geographies/technical centers/business groups do not collaborate as much as they should with one another.  Promotions are very hard to come by unless you play ""office politics"" and actively angle for one. The firm tends to hire senior leaders and managers from outside the company - making internal promotions very difficult to come by. Mid-level managers are not empowered to guide and promote their direct reports - turnover is very high at a junior level.  The company's annual performance review process is nonsensical. The performance review form does not align well with the goal-setting form that employees are required to fill out at the beginning of each year.  Health insurance costs are high compared to other firms, due to the nature of the company and the demographic characteristics of the workforce.",Empower your mid-level managers and younger staff - they are the future of the company. Focus on employee retention programs - losing talent is frustrating for both project management and business development efforts. Update the annual performance review process and follow the path of other consulting firms that are ditching annual reviews in favor of more frequent manager-employee conversations which better meet evolving employee needs.

Leaders stay in their boardroom citadel; staff are kept in the dark---even as layoffs occur. A lack of communication from leadership has created an overactive rumor culture. Project pursuits appear to be approved on leadership's whim as opposed to the business case, and loyalty to leadership seems to be rewarded more than technical excellence or productivity.   Many managers are not open to new ideas and are not up to date on changes in the field. Training is very loose and some new employees get no training at all, and staff are often squeezed by pressure not to charge to projects and not to charge to overhead.   The company has only two tiers: mid-level professionals (5-20 years) are few and far between. The company does not put its money where its mouth is where career development is concerned. Promotions and raises are not tied to performance (they are decided before annual reviews are even in).  Health insurance is expensive and limited to two plans. 401k match is meager and has not increased in many years. Junior staff (<5-8 years) don't get bonuses.   The company's ""furlough"" practice is shady; morale is rock-bottom, turnover is increasing, and management does not seem to care.","Wake up and realize that your billable staff generate revenue and are the product you are selling, so start treating them as something other than a cost and burden.

This applies to my experience only. However, I have seen/heard many similar complaints from other employees in other business lines. And overall senior management sentiment seems shared. Great collegues, interesting projects, relatively large autonomy. Great learning opportunity (even though you will need to learn on your own).","No real opportunities for career advancement. They milk project managers, i.e. compensation is at/below industry and many of the larger projects come with a level of stress you wouldn't have at a smaller firm. Not enough ressources. For such a large firm, it's quite troubling that they are unable to tap into the expertise of their worldwide people.  PMs are forced to work sometimes very long hours, for not much reward. For younger engineers : no real mentorship or structured learning. You will have to do a lot of learning on your own.  Ethics. When one of the sitting board members has been fined for ethics violations, don't preach to your employees about keeping their moral compass straight. We need no lessons from those who have profited from such ethic violations.","People and culture is one of your 4 pillars. A house/building cannot stand straight if one of the pillars is weak and barely holding up. Invest in your people (especially the good ones). And by invest I mean offer more than nice words and incremental changes to benefit packages. Make compensation transparent, and give employees real objectives which, when completed, results in concrete increases in salary."

Being as the company is so large, all graduates are placed on the same slow path of progression. As a motivated graduate there isn't much opportunity to excel or stand out or be rewarded for working hard.  Due to the large scale projects that the company takes on, graduates are limited on what they can contribute and so I found myself being micro-managed for a lot of my time at WSP. Although it was reassuring at first to always have someone looking over my shoulder, I soon wished I could work on smaller projects where I could take on more responsibility.

Line management is very inexperienced and top heavy (too many cost-inefficient layers) with too many approvals required from this structure to progress ANY work. Management do not make any decisions themselves or provide feedback from staff back up the chain. Staff members are made to feel small and undervalued. No emphasis on technical staff achievements and all emphasis and congratulatory speeches are made about people in management or having achieved management status. Not a very friendly atmosphere, all emphasis is on staff utilization with little provision for up-skilling or training. Recently this company has been experiencing high staff turnover as staff recognizing limited scope for career progression and very poor industry pay parity have moved on","WSP New Zealand needs to streamline its management systems and eliminate frankly useless, under trained and pointless middle management that only serves to delay projects, increase stress and frustration of technical staff while driving overhead costs through the roof. Management also needs to recognize and value the personal attributes of staff something that has been completely absent from the start of the takeover 2 years ago."

Used to be a great culture.,"WSP bought the company I worked for (Opus) and it has been a downhill slide since then. It started with little changes (all pot plants removed nationwide, no more free newspaper for staff to read at lunchtime) that then progressed to changing the company management structure (going from a relatively flat structure to bringing in numerous management levels) and now they're making numerous policy changes that make doing our job more difficult and make employees feel like numbers, not people. The new management structure introduced several levels of middle management that are all ineffective and powerless. Technical staff are treated with little respect and policy changes have left us totally disempowered. Graduates are offered good training opportunities but staff above graduate level are offered nothing. The upper management is full of sycophants who constantly ""slap each other on the back"" for what a great job they're doing but don't acknowledge the contribution of technical staff. Numerous staff within the company were forced to take pay cuts due to Covid-19 and the upper management were very keen to inform us of the (tiny) pay cuts they also took, but they've not been very upfront about the significant bonuses many have since been paid. WSP is very quick to jump on the bandwagon when it comes to the latest trendy cause (mental health awareness, lgbt issues, diversity awareness etc) but they only pay lip service to it - they'll happily ""manage out"" staff with mental health issues if they're seen as a financial liability to the company. I felt very loyal to Opus as it was a great place to work - I feel no loyalty to WSP whatsoever.",Get rid of the numerous middle managers.

It believes that employees have responsibilities outside of work. It understands that in order to have successful employees, you need to support them not just financial (but as mentioned earlier, pay is quite competitive), it also supports it's employees with a level of empathy I never even thought possible with other companies. This company has made me feel so proud to be working for it. It gives opportunities to people and gives guidance and chances that you never even thought possible. This company is not just about the earnings. it is also about who you are as a person and what's shocking about all this? is the fact that It actually pushes through with it's promise. that you have their best interest at the heart of everything that they do. What if we can have work-life balance? What if we can be rewarded in ways that support our individual needs? What if we can be accepted for who we are? Here at WSP – we can!

Certainly not under the current management framework.,"I do not gripe about companies when they have their internal flaws, we all know that everyone has them. I do, however, feel very compelled to speak about WSP and their management in Calgary.   I was recruited by their team in pursuit of two major projects in Calgary, only to be laid-off 3 months later. This was most unprofessional after upper management had notified me that my job was not in jeopardy after not being successful on either project. 2 weeks thereafter, I was walked out due to a “business decision”. The Director unapologetically sent me the news without a goodbye, just simply a “pack your things” and go speak to the HR Rep.  Upper management ruled with an iron fist and were not willing to accept any feedback from others during proposal preparation, their own personal and cheesy tactics, nor influence in pursuit of projects. This is not the typical environment of working together as a team that we’ve all become accustomed to in being successful together.   Further, there were points when threats were made by management (second hand news but on more than one occasion), particularly to females. The bias towards males was very evident and unconscionable. It made for a very uncomfortable and ‘thick’ environment when management would exit their offices and spew their non-sensical dissatisfaction to their employees of not securing work.   Anyways, I could go on but I digress. This paints a pretty clear and honest picture of the environment within the Calgary PM office.","Perhaps a review of your systemic issues with not being able to secure work is due to management of the team. The ongoing anger and bias made for a clear division of the team and did not bode well with most. With the remainder, it is my belief that they were simply too afraid to say anything given they knew if they’d had, their time with the group and company was going to be jeopardized."

When you were trying to delegate you had to burn the budget just on training the staff but then immediately bullied. - From trainee technicians to Principal/Senior Engineers you were expected to execute the project managers' design/technical decisions the only difference being in how fast you do it. Because of that, the turnover for Senior Engineers was really high. - Very stressful, low life-work balance and low career progression opportunities due to the extreme boxed/silo environment.  - The worst part ever was that everyone was working on everything depending on their availability, training and knowledge didn't have time to sediment and because people had different working styles there were endless mistakes, quality of final projects poor and delivery chaotic.  - You had no idea what you'll do next week but were constantly under the pressure to deliver. - The communication was either too extreme or too low and due to high stress, some people were very grumpy and unhelpful, doing more harm than good.  - Sometimes departments were acting like in a zero-sum game where everyone fought for resources and power. - The staff was either too stressed, undertrained, underbudgeted, unled and because some felt used as machines, motivation was poor and credibility in management undermined.  - If you're technically sharp you never get promoted and your salary never increases; they only consider you a better horse and if you're cheap, you can easily become everybody's horse.  - the management was constantly making empty promises and were sugar coating me. - too many meetings and emails were burning the budget.","Sediment knowledge and responsibilities in departments, break the silos, be concerned over your staffs' mental health, designate technical coordinators for complex deliveries, reward technically minded people and create career paths for them, minimize swapping the staff through projects."

In reality, they did not win most of them. - Retain useless staff who like to butter the management and literally do no positive contribution to the firm - HR policies are management friendly and not really favorable to the staff - HR folks do not have an answer to most queries of the redundant staff.  - After redundancies are made, HR sends false emails to redundant employees providing details of 'possible' jobs within wsp group. In reality, there are none! They just want to show that they care for the employees. - Personal Friendships mean more to the management that professionalism and hardwork.
