Sure, there are yearly raises and opportunities to ""level up"" to increase your salary, but once you have more than 6 months under your belt, you will cost more than a fresh hire and, regardless of what you do, it seems you cannot stand out. It takes about a 3 weeks to train someone new which is expensive, but after that a new hire can pretty much cross-train on anything, since every position has a slideshow that walks you through every step of every process, eliminating individual value of the employee.

Company does not reward its motivated and hard working employees. Doing the bare minimum ‘button pushers’ make exactly the same as people going above and beyond to outperform. The raises are exactly the same for the worst and best employees. HR is highly incompetent and you won’t be able to get any help from them or hear from them unless you’re in trouble. Company also pays below industry averages. I quit before the layoffs because my boss had lied to me about getting me a significant raise for taking a job in a specialized position of which I was the only trained member, and instead after waiting a whole year opted to pay me the same as button pushers.

Upper leadership is typically unwilling (sometimes insulted) to be challenged by technical and industry experts. This behavior manifests as hubris and arrogance. Technical experts are frequently undermined by upper management’s subjective (limited data driven) decision making processes and typically leads to frustration by the working membership. Short sided thinking (e.g. lopsided cost saving mentality vs. investment mentality) becomes the norm due to the inability of management to clearly stick to any long term, substantive strategic plan. Additionally, high levels of leadership rarely communicate the strategy effectively, and with no mechanisms for the membership to voice concerns (let alone participate in) or get better resolution on the strategic plan (e.g. business checks and balances, explicit low level metrics), makes for a culture of little management accountability. As the business culture continues this way unchallenged, reactionary decision making takes precedence over long term thinking. Progressive thinking “change agent candidates”, be aware of this cultural behavior when considering employment.  Learning and development,  Over the years the company has grown substantially. In its wake (as many call it growing pains), I see it as a company that has outgrown the leadership core’s skills sets. The core functions of the organization instilled with an archaic form of management, consistently struggles to perform up to the CEO’s visionary goals. The CEO seems out of touch with the inner workings of his organization relying on an old school and flawed, vertical reporting system. The man seems very intelligent from folklore, but very seldom addresses the general population let alone takes time to connect with folks below VP levels which makes it hard to establish confidence in his leadership. When the primary performance metric is stock price growth, it’s hard to argue with this metric, however, I view it as being at the cost of neglect of the workers well-being. In my experience stock price has a weak connection to job satisfaction. I don’t believe its greed driving this behavior, rather, the CEO has not driven any cultural growth metrics or put in any leader incentives to drive a more progressive working environment. The behavior drives a hypocritical cultural feel where individual leaders will agree with member concerns in private, but then proceeds publicly to passive-aggressively maintain or even preserve the status quo perhaps out of shame, job security, or they simply agree with the way it is.  Career development There is currently no technical leadership position equivalent (e.g. peer level) to upper management. This structure gives upper management the majority of the leverage in decision making processes and allows discretionary authority over all internal policies including technical decisions. This management structure inhibits growth potential both for employees seeking internal job placement and ability for the business to adapt to changing market conditions because talent is “land-locked” into specific job roles. Although internal training and tuition assistance for Master’s/PhD studies exists, the lack of a supportive career development business structure severely limits one’s potential to move across departments or business groups. Coupled with a severely limited authority/budget in Human Resources, managers that are willing to help employees cross-functionally train cannot justify the costs to upper management and are therefore stifled. A huge hole in the Learning and Development area is a lack of funding that supports functional training programs (e.g. technical classes/coursework). Much if not all of the budget goes toward C-suite initiatives that have seemingly marginal effectiveness. If the leadership communicated the measurable effectiveness of the company wide training I could be persuaded otherwise, but this has never happened.  Wages and Benefits The company benefits by retaining talent and inhibiting wage growth due to a lack of direct local competition for talent. This makes it hard for individuals to seek other employment locally and may need to look south for higher wages. The city is a fantastic place to raise a family and the local culture is friendly and inviting. Benefits are good and probably better than most. The work-life balance is typically in check, but the culture is driven as a “do whatever it takes” mentality and can be costly if you don’t challenge the pressure. It is fine by most to have surges when necessary, however too often than not, poor planning and unrealistic time schedules make it difficult to get out of this rut. I believe a more inclusive leadership would benefit by using input from internal industry experts to alleviate this issue and could adapt.",To the Future Leaders and Managers

As a company, it is positioning itself for the renewable energies market and leveraging its technologies to improve on products produced today. The engineers that work at Woodward take great pride in their work. The level of ingenuity that the engineering staff employs is quite impressive. The vast majority of the controls that Woodward produces are outstanding and exceptionally robust. The level of quality that all of the employees put into their work is quite impressive. Customers have made the statement, ""don't your controls ever fail?"". I can't think of a higher compliment from an end user.","As the size of Woodward has increased, its ability to be responsive to the market and customer's needs, wants, and desires has slowed to a crawl. As a global company, there are several cultures that work for the company. These different cultures are attempting to determine the needs of a market that they are vastly unfamiliar with. Additionally there is a high level of frustration when dealing with fellow employees in different countries that do not understand North American markets and continue to develop products for their own market that do not fit into this market. The best way I can put this is that there are a lot of people talking, but not a lot of communication.","For the CEO and the Vice-Presidents, stop surrounding yourselves with yes-men, brown-nosers, suck-ups and people who simply play to your egos.

Woodward is also generally stable and normally performing well financially. They have invested heavily in updating their facilities. The workplace is very modern in the open-office concept.,"I agree with past reviews, in that the work experience here depends greatly upon your specific job and leader. There are many leaders and individual contributors here that through their own behavior create a toxic and disrespectful atmosphere that in turn creates a lack of trust. Others are obviously incompetent, and some grossly disrespect the boundaries of their job. The most frustrating part is that these situations appear to go on indefinitely, for years at a time while the bad actors don't appear to suffer any sort of consequence.   One other major con of the Niles site is very scarce opportunity for career advancement, and as others have said very meager salary increases. In the time I've been with the company I've seen almost nobody get visibly promoted. The Niles site doesn't appear to be targeted for growth, as the site has seen multiple recent layoffs despite typical to good financial performance. Seniority appears to dominate as most of the top positions at the location appear to be firmly locked down by the longest tenured employees.","The company leadership should do more to maintain a healthy work environment, and should also do more to find growth and advancement opportunities for high value employees, even if they aren't the longest tenured."

It amazes me how companies will keep such a tight purse when it comes to paying to attract and keep top people. They hire new people, pay a relocation package, pay a recruiter, train them for 6 months...all before they start to contribute useful effort to the company. If they would instead, distribute that $50,000 of non-value added expense to current employees, they would keep experienced people, increase moral, and be a much more productive company.","Decide if the Woodward pay structure attracts and keeps top people, or average performers.

Woodward tends to expand by purchasing other companies rather than organic growth of its own product lines. While in general it will treat the acquisitions well, Woodward will take its time fully integrating the company and the acquired persons may never feel fully integrated.

I have worked with some of the most amazing people at Woodward. I am fortunate to be in a group where the people truly like each other and spend a considerable time outside of work together.  The benefits are still above average, however the health benefits have been severely slashed the past two years.   The work is interesting, however since we are such a ""lean"" company most people are stuck in a silo working on the same thing day after day.   The products and engineering that come from Woodward are top notch. Even short staffed, there is no corner cutting and people take great pride in what they do.","Culture: The culture at Woodward has changed over the past 10 years from that of a small ""mom and pop"" company to that of every other large corporation. Anyone other than management is seen as overhead and a burden to the company. The ""lean"" culture that we have adopted serves simply as an excuse to not backfill when someones leaves. The executive management lives in their own world and only cares about meeting monthly numbers and pleasing the shareholders.   Pay/Benefits Pay is below the average, which they can get away with as their is not enough competition in Fort Collins. If another large engineering firms moves into town and actually pays people, Woodward will be hurting. The raise structure is laughable at best as most people are paid the ""affordability rate"" which is almost always less than 3%. There is absolutely no incentive to put in extra effort as you are not rewarded for it and most likely will be burdened with extra work.  Morale: This has probably been the most troubling and most difficult aspect to deal with lately. Morale is absolutely horrible, with some groups worse than others. Woodward has started to lose a number of it's talented people that have been with the company for years which just kills morale. It doesn't feel like anything will change with the current CEO and executive management in charge.  Management: Most of this was covered above but by far the worst part of the company. There are some incredible and talented managers, but by far the majority are ""yes"" men that are only looking after themselves at the expense to the people that work for them. Middle managers can have 40+ people working for them, while directors and executives will only have 2-3 people working under them.",Your talented and experienced people are starting to leave which is eventually going to hit the bottom line. Grow a pair for once and think for yourselves (and the company) rather than what the shareholders want. The culture and morale is toxic and will only change in either personal or thinking from the very top (you Tom) down. Realize that people made this company that it is and celebrate wins rather than only asking for more. This could be one of the most amazing companies for work for...

When I first started here, I began with glowing ambitions. I really wanted to shine brighter than any other employee. I put in the extra work, all the overtime, pushed production to it's limits to produce the most possible product possible.  I was hired on as an official member at 6 months, which was a boost of confidence as I felt it wouldn't ever happen. Spent the next year trying my hardest to work on special projects for my supervisor, going above and beyond.   I was promised a level advancement, over and over. They kept asking more and more from me, but insisted that I was a top performer. Giving me the cold shoulder, stealing ideas from me, etc. Finally, when I was sure my supervisor hated me as he never talked to me, I was given a shining review! I was promised a level advancement once more, but with a two month deadline.  What happened to the deadline? Oh, my supervisor was fired. Then he was replaced with a higher up. Who was too fired. Then we moved to the new facility (WLC). Then I was bounced between two new supervisors until I finally received my level advancement! It was only 8 months late. You know what's the best part?! No increase. Yep, the harder you work, the more time you put in, the more money you make them, it'll never translate for you!  I was given a new title and nothing else. There is no merit in that. ""Thanks for all the hard work! Here's a gold star"" would have worked to the same effect.","You don't pay industry standard, don't kid yourself. If you want people to stay, quit treating them like crap. Also, ENOUGH WITH THE KNEE JERK REACTIONS!! When an issue arises, talk about it, talk with you employees about it. You WILL find an answer to how to handle stuff, quit just throwing more bodies and overtime at issues hoping they go away. If you want to keep people happy, don't run them around with promises of advancement, avoid it until they're ready to quit, then push a new title with no raise on them! One last thing, your raises should be more than inflation. Seriously."

Benefits are decent, I guess, but benefits don't pay the bills. I work with some really amazing people in my department. Despite the ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" management style common here, we do get things done. My direct supervisor cares about us as individuals, and does what he can to help us get our job done. He trusts us to know our jobs and to do them effectively, doesn't micro-manage.","Hmm, where to start? Like most new employees, I was starry-eyed at first, but I was quickly returned to reality the more I learned about this place. In the last year there has been a lot of overturn in the management/supervisory staff. The majority of the ones that are left seem to view the average production worker with disdain, and they disregard and disrespect the years of experience they've gained. Overall, the morale among the membership is the lowest that most can remember. Upper management seems very out of touch (or just doesn't care) about the plight of the rest of us who build the products that enable them to keep their high-profile jobs & salary. Even though Woodward talks a lot about not wasting underutilized talent (read: let people move up from where they are & let them do what they're good at doing) in practice, it's just talk. One of my co-workers applied for a job in the office area where this person actually has a degree to do, and when they asked about the status of their application, were told ""no internal applications are being reviewed at this time."" Imagine the disappointment. Why post the job then? Basically, if you're in production, forget about moving out, even if you have a degree and are very qualified. I had seriously thought about making Woodward a career until I saw how impossible it is to move up, unless you happen to work in a corner office or have a leather chair. They have also raised the specter of outsourcing their assembly work. I've heard stories about how great of a place Woodward was to work at from some of the old-timers. It seems like Woodward is quickly becoming the Wal-Mart of employers here in Fort Collins. The shareholders are probably really happy, though. They're definitely not the employer they were a few years ago.","For Pete's sake, get in touch with your production staff! Some ""Undercover Boss"" behavior would do wonders here. Look at people more and numbers less. Realize that those of us who build the stuff that you sell are the lifeblood of this company, and without that, you have nothing to manage. Pay us what we're worth to Woodward, instead of what other companies pay their production staff. Think outside the box here.
